## 5.12) Add an intro timeline

Create a timeline which enables the LevelController and Hammers after the intro is complete.

Create an animation for the cloud entrance at the start of the level.

<details><summary>How</summary>

Create an intro animation for the cloud:

 - Create an animation for the EvilCloud sprite Animations/**CloudLevel1Entrance**.anim
   - Click record:
     - Start by moving the cloud off screen.
     - Then over time, modify its position to create a dramatic entrance.
 - Select Animations/CloudLevel1Entrance:
   - In the Inspector uncheck 'Loop Time'.

<br>Create an intro Timeline:

 - Select the EvilCloud's sprite.
 - Open menu Window -> Timeline Editor.
   - Click 'Create'.  Save as Assets/Animations/**Level1Entrance**.
   - Select 'Add from Animation Clip' and select CloudLevel1Entrance.

 - Drag the parent Hammers GameObject (which holds all the hammers) onto the timeline and select **Activation Track**.
   - Move the box for the script so that it starts after the cloud animation completes.  
     - The start of the box represents when it will be enabled.
     - The end must align with the end of the time timeline to prevent it from being disabled.

 - Repeat, creating activation tracks for the LevelController and the Ladders.

<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Create an intro animation for the cloud:

We created an entrance for the cloud to play at the start of the level.  This is just for design, so do whatever you like here.  We'll get the spawners to hold until the animation completes in a bit.  

Our animation looks like this at the moment:

<br>Create an intro Timeline:

A Timeline on the EvilCloud is used to coordinate the intro sequence across objects. 

 - It plays the intro animation on the EvilCloud.
 - The Hammers and Ladders are hidden until we start their FadeInThenEnable script with an Activation Track, after the intro animation completes.
 - The Character is spawned after the intro by the Level Manager with an Activation Track.

<details><summary>What is a Unity Timeline / Activation Track?</summary>

Timeline is a new feature released with Unity 2017.  It's a higher level component than the Animator Controller, used to coordinate animations and trigger events across several objects in the scene with an interface that resembles the Animation timeline.

Previously, achieving similiar results would have required a script.  Now you can manage the sequence visually if you prefer.

'Add Animation From Clip' plays an animation during the timeframe specified, overriding what the Animator controller for that object would have done.

Activation Tracks are one of several ways that you trigger behaviour with the Timeline.  An activation track will enable a GameObject where the track begins in the timeline, and disable it again where it ends.  If the activation track ends at the very end of the entire timeline then it will remain active after the timeline completes.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>How might we do this without using the Timeline Editor?</summary>

There are always alternative ways to achieve a goal, particularly true in this case since the Timeline Editor is brand new.

An alternative solution might be something like this:

 - For the EvilCloud, simply play the intro animation with a default state in the Animator Controller.
 - Add a 'InvisibleFor' value to the FadeInThenEnable script, and time that to coordinate with the intro.
 - Add an initial sleep time to the spawner to align with the intro animation.

The advantage to using the Timeline is as you make adjustments to the sequence, you can make those changes visually and aligning the time between objects may be easier.

## 5.13) Disable spawners till the intro is complete

Disable the spawners and create a script to later enable them when the level intro completes.

<details><summary>How</summary>

Enable components when a Timeline event occurs:

 - Create script Components/Animations/**EnableComponentsOnTimelineEvent**:
   - Note there will be compile issues until TimelineEventPlayable is added.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class EnableComponentsOnTimelineEvent : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  TimelineEventPlayable.EventType eventType;

  [SerializeField]
  MonoBehaviour[] componentList;

  public void OnEvent(
    TimelineEventPlayable.EventType currentEventType)
  {
    if(currentEventType == eventType)
    {
      EnableComponents(componentList);
    }
  }
  
  static void EnableComponents(
    MonoBehaviour[] componentList)
  {
    for(int i = 0; i < componentList.Length; i++)
    {
      MonoBehaviour component = componentList[i];
      component.enabled = true;
    }
  }
}
```

 - For both the cloud and door:
   - Disable the **Spawner** component.
   - Add **EnableComponentsOnTimelineEvent**.
     - Add the Spawner component to its list.

<br>Create a Timeline event:

 - Create script Playables/**TimelineEventPlayable**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Playables;
using UnityEngine.Timeline;

public class TimelineEventPlayable : BasicPlayableBehaviour
{
  public enum EventType
  {
    AlmostAtStart, Start, End
  }

  [SerializeField]
  EventType eventType;

  public override void OnBehaviourPlay(
    Playable playable,
    FrameData info)
  {
    base.OnBehaviourPlay(playable, info);

    EnableComponentsOnTimelineEvent[] componentList
      = GameObject.FindObjectsOfType<EnableComponentsOnTimelineEvent>();

    for(int i = 0; i < componentList.Length; i++)
    {
      EnableComponentsOnTimelineEvent component = componentList[i];
      component.OnEvent(eventType);
    }
  }
}
```

 - Drag drop the script into the timeline.  Set the time like we did for the Hammers.
   - In the Inspector, change the 'Event Type' to 'Start'.
 - Drag the script in a second time and set the time to fire a bit before the animation ends.

<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Enable components when a Timeline event occurs:

EnableComponentsOnLevelLoad is used to enable specific components during the intro sequence (as opposed to the entire GameObject).  There are three event types supported:

 - Almost At Start: fired a few moments before the end of the intro.
 - Start: fired once the intro sequence is complete.
 - End: fired once the player has beat the level.

We add this to EvilCloud and the door so that their sprites are visible but the spawners are not enabled until the intro animations completes.

<br>Create a Timeline event:
 
TimelineEventPlayable is the component which we add to the Timeline to call each of the EnableComponentsOnLevelLoad in the scene.  We add this twice to the intro Timeline, one for the the 'Almost at start' event and another for the 'Start' event.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What is a BasicPlayableBehaviour / when is OnBehaviourPlay called?</summary>

A BasicPlayableBehaviour is like a MonoBehaviour but for scripts to be used in the Timeline (vs on a GameObject directly).

OnBehaviourPlay is a Unity event called when the script begins on the timeline.  Note that here Unity uses override instead of the reflection pattern used with MonoBehaviour events.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's a C# 'enum'?</summary>

An enum is a set of named constants.  The constants are by default type int and count sequentially starting from 0.  For example:

```csharp
enum Example 
{
  A, B, C
}
```

is similiar to

```csharp
const int A = 0;
const int B = 1;
const int C = 2;
```

Enums are often used to bring a related set of constants together.  They have some additional benefits over listing the constants individually such as:

 - You can iterate all possible values using System.Enum.GetValues.
 - You can use ToString to get the named value.
 - Clarifies intent, making it easier to know what values should be accepted.

Consider using an enum if the set of values is known at compile time.

## 5.14) Rotate platforms during intro

Platforms start out straight and then when the intro animation is nearly complete, shake down into position.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Create script Components/Movement/**RotateOvertimeToOriginal**:

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;

public class RotateOvertimeToOriginal : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  float rotationFactor = 1;

  [SerializeField]
  float maxTimeBetweenRotations = .25f;

  Quaternion targetRotation;

  protected void Awake()
  {
    targetRotation = transform.rotation;
    transform.rotation = Quaternion.identity;
  }

  protected void Start()
  {
    StartCoroutine(AnimateRotation());
  }

  IEnumerator AnimateRotation()
  {
    float percentComplete = 0;
    float sleepTimeLastFrame = 0;
    while(true)
    {
      sleepTimeLastFrame 
        = UnityEngine.Random.Range(0, maxTimeBetweenRotations);
      yield return new WaitForSeconds(sleepTimeLastFrame);
      sleepTimeLastFrame = Mathf.Max(Time.deltaTime, sleepTimeLastFrame);

      float percentCompleteThisFrame = sleepTimeLastFrame * rotationFactor;
      percentCompleteThisFrame *= UnityEngine.Random.Range(0, 10);
      percentComplete += percentCompleteThisFrame;
      if(percentComplete >= 1)
      {
        transform.rotation = targetRotation;
        yield break;
      }
      transform.rotation = Quaternion.Lerp(
        Quaternion.identity, 
        targetRotation, 
        percentComplete);
    }
  }
}
```

 - For each Platform:
   - Add **RotateOvertimeToOriginal**:
     - Disable the component.
   - Add **EnableComponentsOnLevelLoad**:
     - Add RotateOvertimeToOriginal to the 'Components to enable on almost loaded'.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

When the level begins, RotateOvertimeToOriginal stores the object's original rotation (as it was placed in the scene).  We then change the rotation before the first render on-screen to Quaternion.identity, or the default rotation for the sprite.

A coroutine periodically lerps rotation back to the original.  We use RNG, both for a random sleep time between rotation changes and to randomize how much the rotation changes by.  Our goal here is to make it not smooth, as if it were falling / shaking into place.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's C# yield break do?</summary>

Enumerators are methods which can 'yield return' and then later be resumed from where they left off.  Coroutines in Unity are enumerators.  

When working with enumerators, 'yield break' will return from the method and indicate that it's complete and cannot be resumed again.

<hr></details>

## 5.15) Add screen shake during intro

Shake the screen when the platforms fall into place.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Create script Components/Animations/**ScreenShake**:

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;

public class ScreenShake : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  float timeToShakeFor = 1;

  [SerializeField]
  float maxTimeBetweenShakes = .2f;

  [SerializeField]
  float shakeMagnitude = 1;

  protected void Start()
  {
    StartCoroutine(ShakeCamera());
  }

  IEnumerator ShakeCamera()
  {
    Camera camera = Camera.main;
    Vector3 startingPosition = camera.transform.position;

    float timePassed = 0;
    while(timePassed < timeToShakeFor)
    {
      float percentComplete = timePassed / timeToShakeFor;
      percentComplete *= 2;
      if(percentComplete > 1)
      {
        percentComplete = 2 - percentComplete;
      }
      Vector2 deltaPosition 
        = UnityEngine.Random.insideUnitCircle * shakeMagnitude * percentComplete;
      camera.transform.position = startingPosition + (Vector3)deltaPosition;

      float maxTime = maxTimeBetweenShakes * (1 - percentComplete);
      float sleepTime 
        = UnityEngine.Random.Range(0, maxTime);
      yield return new WaitForSeconds(sleepTime);
      sleepTime = Mathf.Max(Time.deltaTime, sleepTime);
      timePassed += sleepTime;
    }

    camera.transform.position = startingPosition;
  }
}
```

 - Select the camera:
   - Add **ScreenShake** and disable the component.
   - Add **EnableComponentsOnLevelLoad**.
     - Event Type: Almost At Start
     - Add its ScreenShake component to the component list.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

ScreenShake moves the camera up/down/left/right randomly to create a shaking effect.  The effect lasts for a limited time and scales up in magnitude (i.e. the intensity of the shake) and then back down.  This component is enabled when the intro Timeline is almost complete, and that event aligns with the cloud bouncing - making it look like the cloud is shaking the platforms into place.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What is the script doing with percent complete?</summary>

Our goal is to smoothly transition from 0 to 1 and then back to 0.  We use this value as a multiple on how much we move the camera that frame - smoothing the start and end of the effect.

We do this by doubling the percent complete and then if greater than 1, use 2 - the value.  This gives us the desired 0 -> 1 -> 0 curve.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What does Random.insideUnitCircle do?</summary>

Random.insideUnitCircle is a convenience method giving you a random point which falls on a circle with a radius of 1.  We take that value and then multiple it by the desired magnitude, effectively giving us a random point on a larger, or smaller, circle; and then position that the camera that far from its original position.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What else could we add to the shake effect?</summary>

Here are a few ideas on how you might be able to make this effect even cooler:

 - Randomly change the z Rotation in addition to the position.
 - Randomly change the orthographic size, causing the camera to zoom in and out.
 - The current shake algorithm is uses a random offset from the camera's original position, you may be able to improve the effect by giving consideration to the camera position the previous frame.
 - Add a post processing effect such as blur.  Post processing effects refer to scripts you can add to your camera, modifying the display to create an effect such as blur or bloom.  Here are some [post processing effects, free from Unity](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/83912), you can use.
