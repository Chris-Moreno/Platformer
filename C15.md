## To Review, Level 2

Create level 2 reusing a lot from level 1 but change various configurations such as having the cloud spawn HoverGuy enemies.  

The win condition for this level, to be added later, will be to jump over each of the breakaway platforms we add here.  

<details><summary>How</summary>

Create prefabs from Level 1 to reuse:

 - Open Level1 and create prefabs for:
   - Main Camera
   - Canvas
   - EventSystem
   - 1 Platform (any is fine, we will use this as a starting point in Level2).
   - 1 Ladder
   - EvilCloud
   - LevelController

<br>Start to design level 2 with prefabs from level 1:

 - Open Level2.
 - Delete the Main Camera.
 - Drag in the following prefabs:
   - Main Camera
   - Canvas
   - EventSystem
   - EvilCloud
   - LevelController
     - Level Number: 2
     - Select the Director
 - Add the Platform, Ladder, Hammer prefabs and any new art you would like to include.  
   - Copy / paste as needed to layout the level.
   - Note that it's okay to 'Break the prefab instance' while making changes.
   - Add a **Rigidbody2D** to each of the center platforms.
     - Freeze the Position and Rotation.
 - Add the Mushroom as well.  We are using **spritesheet_jumper_26**.
   - Add **PolygonCollider2D**.
   - Add **Rigidbody2D**:
     - Freeze the Position (X and Y) and Rotation.

<br>Add a section at the top where the Character cannot enter:

 - Add a Block at the top, we are using **spritesheet_ground_9**.
   - Add **Rigidbody2D**.
     - Freeze the Position and Rotation.
   - Add **BoxCollider2D**.
 - Create a layer 'CharacterOnly':
   - Disable CharacterOnly / Enemy and CharacterOnly / Feet collisions.
   - Assign it to all the blocks at the top and the mushroom.

<br>Add the breakaway sections:

  - Add a Breakaway GameObject and sprite, we are using **spritesheet_jumper_69**.
    - Set to Layer **Floor**.
    - Add **TouchMeToWin**.
    - Add **PolygonCollider2D** for collisions.
    - Add **Rigidbody2D**.
    - Add **BoxCollider2D**, set it as a trigger and size it to capture the area above.

<br>Configure the enemy:

 - Drag the HoverGuy prefab into the scene.
   - Rename it "HoverGuy2".
   - Remove the **FadeInThenEnable** component.
   - Enable the **WanderWalkController**:
     - Time Before First Wander: 0
   - Change the **RandomClimbController**
     - Odds of going up: .1
     - Odds of going down: .9
   - Create a new prefab for HoverGuy2 and delete the GameObject.
 - Select the EvilCloud and change the Thing To Spawn to HoverGuy2.

<br>Create the intro Timeline:

 - Select the EvilCloud's sprite GameObject and create a new animation  Animations/**CloudLevel2Entrance**.
   - Record any sequence you'd like.
   - Select Animations/CloudLevel2Entrance and disable looping.
 - Create a 'Timeline' file at Animations/**Level2Entrance**.
 - Select the EvilCloud's sprite GameObject and change the Playable Director's Playable to Level2Entrance.
 - Open the Timeline Editor window:
   - Add an Animation Track for the EvilCloud 
     - Add an Animation Clip for CloudLevel2Entrance.
     - Update the speed if needed.
   - Add Activation Tracks for the Hammers, Ladders, and LevelController.  
     - Time them to start near the end of the animation.
     - And end at the end of the timeline.
   - Then disable the Hammers, Ladders, and LevelController.

<br>Create the outro Timeline:

 - Create a new Scene named Scenes/**YouWin**:
   - Add it to Build Settings.
   - Return to Level2.
 - Create a new animation on the EvilCloud for the end of the game, named Animations/**CloudLevel2Exit**.
 - Create a new Timeline Animations/**Level2Exit** and select it in the Playable Director.
 - Open the Timeline Editor:
   - Create an **Animation Track** for the EvilCloud's CloudLevel2Exit clip.
     - Adjust the speed.
   - Add **TimelineEventPlayable**:
     - Position it to start about half way through the animation.
     - Change the Event Type to End.
   - Add **ChangeScenePlayable**:
      - Position it to start a few seconds after the TimelineEventPlayable began.
      - Change the Scene Name to "YouWin".
 - Select the LevelController and change the End of Level Playable to Level2Exit.
 - Switch the Playable Director back to Level2Entrance.

<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Create prefabs from Level 1 to reuse:

We create prefabs to save time creating Level 2. Some of these will be used with the same configurations as used in Level 1, others will be modified specifically for level 2.  

<br>Start to design level 2 with prefabs from level 1:

We construct most of level 2 by reusing GameObjects created for level 1, making customizations where needed. The layout is a lot different from level 1 but we are reusing the same core Platforms.  Level 2 will have a unique win condition, which is why we did not copy that from level 1.

Rigidbody was added to the center platforms and the mushroom.  We then constrain the body, effectively disabling it by default.  This will allow us to turn off the constraints when the player beats the level, causing them to fall to the ground.

<br>Add a section at the top where the Character cannot enter:

The win condition for this level is breaking each of the breakaway blocks.  We don't want you to be able to reach the mushroom as you did in level 1.  Blocks are added to guard the mushroom and a layer is used to allow enemies to pass through but block the player.

The rigidbody is added so this may also fall at the level's end.

<br>Add the breakaway sections:

To beat level 2 you need to jump or walk over each of the breakaway platforms.  

 - The layer floor allows the FloorDetector to work while standing on these platforms.
 - TouchMeToWin counts down the number of breakaway platforms remaining in order to trigger the end of the level.  
 - The polygon collider is used for collisions as entities walk over and for when it's falling.
 - The rigidbody is added so this may fall at the level's end.
 - The box collider is used to detect when the Character is jumping or walking over.

<br>Configure the enemy:

A new prefab was created specifically for level 2.  It's a slight modification to the settings on the HoverGuy we used in level 1.

 - FadeInThenEnable is removed so that the enemy starts moving as soon as it's dropped from the cloud.
 - WanderWalkController removes the initial sleep so it does not always walk right in the beginning.
 - RandomClimbController updates odds so that enemies travel down more often then up.

<br>Create the intro Timeline:

A new Timeline was created for the start of the level.  It's modeled after the Timeline used with level 1. 

 - The cloud is given a new animation to start with for this level.
 - We disable the Hammers, Ladders, and LevelController until the animation is near complete, like we had done with level 1.

<br>Create the outro Timeline:

The Timeline for the end of the level is also modeled after level 1.  

 - The cloud is given a new animation to end with.
 - TimelineEventPlayable broadcasts the end of the level to other interested components.
 - The Timeline ends with ChangeScene, taking us to the YouWin scene.

<details><summary>What does it mean to 'Break the prefab instance'?</summary>

This dialog sounds more serious than it is.  Breaking the prefab instance means that Unity will no longer tie this GameObject to a prefab - so if the prefab were to change the GameObject will not receive the update.  

The prefab itself is still in-tact and may be used for other objects or scenes.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>When freezing the rigidbody a warning appears, why do it this way?</summary>

When you freeze all constraints on the rigidbody, Unity presents a warning that this may not be an efficient way to achieve your goal of preventing the object from moving.  We have a bit of a unique use case for this case -- we will be removing these constraints once the end of the level is reached, allowing them to fall to the ground.

Alternatively you could have not included the rigidbody at all until the end of the level.  This is style preference, as well as a bit of a performance consideration as there is overhead to having a frozen rigidbody and there is overhead with adding a new component to a GameObject.

## Level 2 breakaway sequence

Once the character has touched each of the Breakaway platforms, make the level collapse.

<details><summary>How</summary>

Enable physics, causing the level to collapse:

 - Create script Components/Effects/**UnfreezeAndDisablePlatformers**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class UnfreezeAndDisablePlatformers : MonoBehaviour
{
  protected void OnEnable()
  {
    Rigidbody2D myBody = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
    myBody.constraints = RigidbodyConstraints2D.None;

    PlatformEffector2D effector 
      = GetComponent<PlatformEffector2D>();
    if(effector != null)
    {
      effector.enabled = false;
    }
  }
}
```

 - For each Block guarding the mushroom, each platform in the center (except the bottom platform), and the mushroom:
   - Add **UnfreezeAndDisablePlatformers**.
     - Disable the component.
   - Add **EnableComponentsOnTimelineEvent**:
     - Event: End
     - Component list: UnfreezeAndDisablePlatformers

<br>Breakaway blocks fall when touched:

 - For each breakaway block:
   - Add **UnfreezeAndDisablePlatformers**.
   - Update TouchMeToWin to enable the Unfreeze component.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Enable physics, causing the level to collapse:

The Timeline which plays when the level ends will enable UnfreezeAndDisablePlatformers.  That component will then:

 - Remove all constraints on the rigidbody, allowing it to fall.
 - Disable the platform effector, if there is one.  This ensures there is no weird behaviour due to the one-way collisions from the platformer effect while the platform itself is falling and spinning.

<br>Breakaway blocks fall when touched:

When the player jumps over one of the breakaway blocks, UnfreezeAndDisablePlatformers is used to cause it to fall.

## GG screen

Design a scene to display when the player wins the game.  Here we drop a bunch of random "GG"s from the sky.

<details><summary>How</summary>

Configure scene:

 - Open the YouWin scene.
 - Configure the Camera color.
 - Add the GameController prefab.

<br>Create a GG object:

 - Create an Empty GameObject named "GG".
   - Add **TextMesh**:
     - Text: "GG"
     - Font Size: 36
     - Anchor: Middle Center
     - Alignment: Center
   - Add **BoxCollider2D**:
     - Size it tightly around the GG letters.
   - Add **Rigidbody2D**.
   - Add **SuicideIn** and set the time to 30.

<br>Randomize the GG:

 - Create script Components/Effects/**RandomGG**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class RandomGG : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  float minScale = .1f;

  [SerializeField]
  float maxScale = .7f;

  protected void OnEnable()
  {
    transform.localScale 
      = Vector3.one * UnityEngine.Random.Range(minScale, maxScale);

    TextMesh text = GetComponent<TextMesh>();
    text.color = UnityEngine.Random.ColorHSV();

    Bounds screenBounds = GameController.instance.screenBounds;
    transform.position = new Vector3(
      UnityEngine.Random.Range(screenBounds.min.x, screenBounds.max.x),
      screenBounds.max.y + 10,
      0);
  }
}
```

 - Add **RandomGG** to the GG GameObject.

<br>Keep the GG in bounds:

 - Create an Empty GameObject and add a **BoxCollider2D**
   - Size and position multiple to guard the screen edges.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KI8JXHK.png" width=300px />

<br>Spawn GGs:

- Create Prefabs/**GG** and delete the GameObject.
- Create an Empty GameObject named Spawner.
  - Add **Spawner** component
    - Initial wait time: 0
    - Min time: .1
    - Max time: 1
    - Thing to spawn: GG

<br>Press any key to return to the menu:

 - Create script Components/UI/**AnyKeyToLoadScene**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

public class AnyKeyToLoadScene : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  string sceneName = "Menu";

  protected void Update()
  {
    if(Input.anyKeyDown)
    {
      SceneManager.LoadScene(sceneName);
    }
  }
}
```

 - Add **AnyKeyToLoadScene** to the Spawner.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Configure scene:

The YouWin scene is given a black background.  The GameController is added so that components can get the screen bounds from it, it's a DontDestroyOnLoad component but added here to ease testing.  

<br>Create a GG object:

A GameObject is created to display "GG".  We size it too large to start and will scale it down.  A box collider surrounds the letters so we can drop a bunch and have them bounce off each other.  The rigidbody enables gravity.  Suicide in destroys the GG after 30 seconds, ensuring there is always some movement on the screen.

<br>Randomize the GG:

RandomGG will, when the GameObject is first added to the scene:

  - Pick a new random size, always smaller than the original (to ensure a crisp font).
  - Pick a random color.
  - Pick a random position which is a bit above the screen.

<br>Keep the GG in bounds:

Invisible bumpers were added off-screen in order to get the GG objects to collect on-screen.  They will bounce around a bit and some GGs will be completely off-screen, but most should be visible.

<br>Spawn GGs:

The Spawner component used in our levels was reused here to spawn GGs.  The position of the Spawner does not matter as the RandomGG script will override the GameObject's position.  The time between spawns was greatly reduced, giving a pretty steady stream of GGs falling.

<br>Press any key to return to the menu:

Each update, the AnyKeyToLoadScene script checks if any key was pressed that frame.  We check AnyKeyDown instead of AnyKey so that the player does not accidentally skip the GG scene entirely.

This script could have been added to any GameObject in the world, using the Spawner was an arbitrary choice.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why a TextMesh instead of UI Text?</summary>

UI Text does not work with physics.  It's intended to be used on a Canvas and not have any interaction with objects in the world.  

Text Mesh can be added to a GameObject, allowing you to add a rigidbody for gravity and a collider to get them bouncing around.  Note that features built for the UI Text component, for example the Outline component, are not compatible with the Text Mesh.
