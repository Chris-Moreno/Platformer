# 2D Platformer Tutorial for Unity 2017

TODO intro. Setting up 'pixel perfect'.
[Demo of the game](https://hardlydifficult.com/Kong/index.html)

Target audience: we try to assume little without boring those with experience.  You don't need to know how to code and it's okay if this is your first time with Unity.  You can follow step-by-step and copy/paste scripts, but we aim to teach the process along the way as well.  New concepts are introduced as they come to help beginners and intermediate developers understand.  

TODO encourage experimenting along the way.  At the start of each chapter we have a download with the project up to that point.  Hack away, then reset to the baseline and hack some more.

TODO legal - MIT for source and cc attribution for the text itself.

This is very much a WIP.  I'm trying to make a tutorial helpful to a range of experience levels.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions - I'm creating this live at [twitch.tv/HardlyDifficult](https://twitch.tv/HardlyDifficult) or email nick@HardlyDifficult.com


Process plan (constantly changing...)

 - ~~Complete draft of step-by-step~~
 - ~~Refactor code~~
 - ~~Clean steps and draft What did that do and a first cut on FAQ.~~
 - Then big edits - re-organize and add missing FAQs.
 - Rework the what did that section vs the blurb at top, extract more questions.
 - Chapter by chapter:
   - Review the chapter one more time.
   - Record video.
   - Throw the videos out for editing, how are we cutting/presenting things?
   - Finalize draft including
      - Code snippets and links with comments (double check folders)
      - Screenshots / gifs
      - Asset links
      - Intro/outro
   - Start grammar reviews.
