## UI for points

Display the number of points in the top right.

<details><summary>How</summary>

Create and position the points text:

 - In the Hierarchy, right click create UI -> **Text**.
   - This creates a Canvas and a Text GameObject.
 - Select the "Text" GameObject:
   - Name it "Points".
   - Pivot: (1, 1)
   - Paragraph Alignment: Right
   - Anchor: Top right

 - Use the move tool to position the text in the top right (you may need to zoom out a lot).
 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/r7g1W7y.png" width=500px />

<br>Style the text:

 - Select the Text GameObject:
   - Color: white
   - Font: kenpixel_future
   - Font size: 32 (text may disappear)
   - Height: 40 (text should be too large)
   - Width: 500
   - Use the scale tool to scale down until its a good size.

<br>Update the text when the player earns points:

 - Create script Components/UI/**TextPoints**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class TextPoints : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  float scrollSpeed = .1f;

  Text text;

  int lastPointsDisplayed;

  protected void Awake()
  {
    text = GetComponent<Text>();

    Debug.Assert(text != null);
  }

  protected void Update()
  {
    int currentPoints = GameController.instance.points;
    int deltaPoints = currentPoints - lastPointsDisplayed;
    if(deltaPoints > 0)
    {
      float speed = scrollSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
      float pointsTarget =
        Mathf.Lerp(lastPointsDisplayed, currentPoints, speed);
      int pointsToDisplay = Mathf.CeilToInt(pointsTarget);
      text.text = pointsToDisplay.ToString("N0");
      lastPointsDisplayed = pointsToDisplay;
    }
  }
}
```

 - Add **TextPoints** to the Points GameObject.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Create and position the points text:

A canvas was created to hold the text for points, we'll add more to this canvas soon.  We set the anchor and pivot to the top right and position the text in the corner of the canvas.

<br>Style the text:

Kenpixel_future is a fixed width font, which makes the points look a little better as the values are changing.  We set the font size too large and then scale down to size to get a crisp display.

<br>Update the text when the player earns points:

TextPoints uses Lerp to scroll the number of points displayed up until reaching the current value.  This means if the player earns 100 points, we may see 10 the first frame and 17 the second frame, 20 the third, etc where the number of points increasing each frame slows down as it approaches the actual value.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's a canvas do and why is our level so small in comparison?</summary>

The Canvas is a container holding UI.  It allows Unity to manage features such as automatically scaling UI to fit the current resolution.  Unity offers components such as the VerticalLayoutGroup which help in getting positioning and sizing correct.

Canvas appears in the Scene window along side other objects in the game.  It's huge, and overlaps the world center a little.  This is an arbitrary decision from Unity - the Canvas is actually completely separate from the rest of the game.  I believe they choose to display this way as a simplification so you don't need another window for editing.

You can use the Layers button in the editor to hide UI if you prefer, allowing you to just look at the game or level design.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why size the font too large and then scale it down?</summary>

Fonts by default may look blurry.  We size the font too large and then scale it down via the RectTransform to fit in order to make the rendering more clear for users.

Here is an example, the top is sized only using font size while the bottom is oversized and then scaled down:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qLqSeRV.png" width=300px />

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What is a RectTransform, how does it differ from a Transform?</summary>

A RectTransform is the UI version of the Transform used for GameObjects.  RectTransform inherits from Transform, adding features specifically for UI positioning such as pivot points and an anchor.  Anything displayed in a Canvas must use a RectTransform... as that is how Canvas does layout and positioning.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why use ceiling here?</summary>

We need to ensure that each iteration of Update increases the points displayed by at least one, if we are not already displaying the final value.  Without this, it's possible each Update would calculate less than 1 - if we simply cast that means that each update would progress by 0 and therefore never actually display the correct amount.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What does setting the anchor point / pivot on UI do?</summary>

Setting the anchor changes how the position for the Rect is determined.  The default is center, which means places (0, 0) at the center of the screen.  The unit for these coordinates is pixels.  

As the screen size changes, the offset from the anchor point is still defined in pixels.  If we positioned the points with a center anchor, it would not be position correctly when the resolution changed.

Pivot point is the spot in the GameObject which is used for positioning against the anchor.  It is defined in percent of the object's size, 0 to 1.  So if we have an anchor point of top right and the pivot is center (.5, .5) than the position (0, 0) will center the object in the corner, causing half of it to be offscreen.  Switch the pivot point to (1, 1) and the entire object is visible.

Unity also offers the Canvas Scaler component on the Canvas GameObject which can be used to automatically update position and sizing when the resolution changes.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's C# ToString("N0") do?</summary>

ToString is available on all types in C#.  When using ToString to convert a number, you may optionally include format codes like this.  "N0" is a common one.

 - "N" states it should formatted as a number, with commas in the states and periods in Europe, etc (e.g. 12,000,000).
 - "0" means any decimal places should not be included (e.g. 1000.234 would display as 1,000).

There are a lot of options when it comes to generating strings.  Read [more from Microsoft here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/formatting-types).

## UI for lives

Add sprites to display how many lives remain.

<details><summary>How</summary>

Add sprites for lives:

 - Add an Empty GameObject as a child to the Canvas, named "Lives".
   - Add **HorizontalLayoutGroup**:
     - Spacing: 30
     - Child Alignment: Upper Right
     - Uncheck Child Force Expand Width
 - Add an **Image** to the Canvas as well, named "Life".
   - Change the Source Image.  We are using **spritesheet_jumper_62**.
   - Copy / paste Life so that there are 3.
 - Position the Lives GameObject under the Points.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yZXrKUG.png" width=150px />

<br>Animate hiding the life sprite on death:

 - Create script Components/UI/**LifeLine**:

```csharp
using System;
using UnityEngine;

public class LifeLine : PlayerDeathMonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  int lifeCount = 1;

  public override void OnPlayerDeath()
  {
    if(GameController.instance.lifeCounter < lifeCount)
    {
      DeathEffectManager.PlayDeathEffectsThenDestroy(gameObject);
    }
  }
}
```

 - Select each of the Life GameObjects (all 3).
   - Add **LifeLine**:
     - Change the lifeCount for each so that the first is 3, the second 2, and the last 1.
   - Add **DeathEffectThrob**.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Add sprites for lives:

3 sprites were added to represent the number of lives remaining.  The  HorizontalLayoutGroup is used to position the sprites -- this approach is optional, there are other ways you could have achieved the same layout.

Animate hiding the life sprite on death:

When the player dies, LifeLine triggers DeathEffects on itself if the player just lost the life point that sprite represents.  DeathEffectThrob causes the sprite to animate its death by scaling up and down and getting smaller until its gone.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>How does the HorizontalLayoutGroup work?</summary>

The Horizontal Layout Group places its child GameObjects next to each other, side by side. There are various options for controlling the layout, such as:

 - Spacing: Adds padding between each of the child GameObjects.
 - Child Alignment: Defines if the child GameObjects should appear in the center, left, or right, etc of this GameObject.
 - Child Force Expand: Causes the child GameObjects to get wider, filling the entire parent GameObject.  This appears as whitespace between objects.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why an Image and not a Sprite?</summary>

Image is essentially a special kind of sprite with a RectTransform, to be used with a Canvas.  The Canvas and its associated components, such as the HorizontalLayoutGroup, only work with GameObjects that have a RectTransform.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What does Child Force Expand Width?</summary>

Force Expand Width will automatically increase the Spacing so that the Images fill the entire container.  If we were to use this, and get things positioned correctly by modifying the RectTransform width - it may look correct at the start but once one of the lives is destroyed, the others would re-layout to fill that gap... and that would look wrong.

## Main menu

TODO add a music track

Create a main menu to show at the start of the game.  Allow the player to start Level 1 and when the game is over, return to the menu.

<details><summary>How</summary>

Create the Menu scene:

 - Create a new Scene, save it as Scenes/**Menu**.
   - Add the Scene to Build Settings.
     - Drag and drop it so that it is the first scene in the list.
 - Add the GameController prefab.

<br>Design the scene:

 - Add a Platform sprite to the bottom.
   - Add **BoxCollider2D**.
   - Layer: **Floor**
 - Add the Character prefab.
   - Add **WanderWalkController**.
   - Add **BounceOffScreenEdges**.
   - Remove the **PlayerController**.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QCrcf66.png" width=150px />

 - Add the EvilCloud sprite
   - Create an animation to loop, named Animations/**MenuCloud**.
   - Adjust the playback speed in the Animator Controller.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dM4LFPk.png" width=300px />

<br>Add a play button:

 - Create UI -> Button, named "Play".
 - Select the Canvas GameObject:
   - Canvas Scaler UI Scale Mode: **Scale with Screen Size**
 - Select the Play GameObject:
   - Change the Source Image.  We are using **spritesheet_tiles_22**.
   - Position the button on the menu screen.
 - Select the Text GameObject under Play.
   - Text: "Play"
   - Color: black
   - Font Size: 50
   - RectTransform Top: about -22 so the text is positioned well on the sign.
    
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bDZ5dr5.png" width=150px />

 - Create script Components/UI/**ButtonChangeScene**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

public class ButtonChangeScene : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  string sceneName;

  public void OnClickLoadScene()
  {
    SceneManager.LoadScene(sceneName);
  }
}
```

 - Select the Play GameObject:
   - Add **ButtonChangeScene** and enter "Level1" for the scene name.
   - Under the button component, create a new OnClick event.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bGdqYZK.png" width=150px />

 - Drag and drop the ButtonChangeScene component onto the click event object box and then select the OnClickLoadScene event.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8EHUfAd.gif" width=300px />

<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Create the Menu scene:

A scene for the Menu was added as the first scene in build settings so that it's what you see first when starting the game.  

<br>Design the scene:

A simple platform was added the bottom for the character to walk on.  The character prefab is reused but we modify the configuration, swapping the PlayerController for the random movement components we used on HoverGuy.

<br>Add a play button:

When the button was added, a Canvas was automatically created.  Canvas was configured to Scale with Screen Size so that the button looks the same at all resolutions.

ButtonChangeScene exposes a public method that we wire up to be called by Unity's Button component when the button is clicked.

<br>Return to the menu after losing:

The LevelController was updated, leveraging the YouLose placeholder created earlier to return to the menu once the player is out of lives.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Does order matter for scenes in the Build Settings?</summary>

The first enabled scene in Build Settings list is what appears first when playing the game.  Drag and drop scenes to change their order in that list.

You can disable scenes in Build Settings by unchecking the box, this excludes that scene from the build.  You can also select and hit Delete.

The order beyond the first does not matter for anything except for the index ID they are assigned.  When loading a scene you can either load by name or by index.  

I prefer using the name, as code is easier to follow.  You might also consider using an enum to define each scene in the correct order.  This way it's easier to maintain code if scene names or the order changes.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why Remove Component instead of disable it?</summary>

Either way should work.  I find it more clear to remove the component instead of just leaving it disabled as it's easier to understand what's happening with that GameObject.  Several times in this tutorial we have GameObjects with components which are disabled by default - all of them may be enabled if the right use case triggers it.  So removing the component clearly indicates there is no PlayerController in the menu, vs maybe there is a hidden way of enabling it.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>How does the Canvas Scaler / Scale with Screen Size work?</summary>

The Canvas Scaler controls the size of UI elements on the screen.  The default is constant pixel size which means that as the resolution gets larger, the relative size of UI is smaller (i.e. it does not scale up).  We are using Scale with Screen Size with makes UI elements bigger the bigger the screen is.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>How do UI events / button OnClick events work?</summary>

When an event occurs, such as OnClick for buttons, you can execute any number of methods.  Hit plus to add another event to call.  

To call an event, you first select the GameObject you want to operate on.  Once selected, each of the components on the GameObject are selectable from the event list.

Often you will be calling an event on the same object like we did here.
