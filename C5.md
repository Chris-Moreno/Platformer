Spawn in a new enemy which hovers above the ground.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Create the HoverGuy**:

 - Select **flyMan_fly**, **_jump**, and **_stand** and drag them into the Scene, creating Assets/Animations/**HoverGuyWalk**.
   - Order in Layer: 1
 - Add the sprite to a parent GameObject named "HoverGuy":
   - Layer: Enemy
   - Add a **Rigidbody2D**:
     - Freeze the Z rotation.
   - Add a **CapsuleCollider2D**:
     - Adjust the size to fit the sprite's body.

<br>**Make HoverGuy float**:

 - Create a Layer for "Feet".
 - Update the Physics 2D collision matrix:
   - Disable Feet / Enemy.
   - Disable Feet / Feet.
 - Add an empty GameObject as a child under the HoverGuy named "Feet".
   - Layer: Feet
   - Add a **CircleCollider2D** 
     - Radius: .1
     - Position it a little below the sprite.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BPohw5V.png" width=150px />

<br>**Add a spawner**:

- Drag in each of the door sprites one at a time.  We are using **doorOpen_mid** and **_top**.
   - Order in Layer: -20
 - Add them to a parent named "Door":
   - Scale up the size of the Door to (1.5, 1.5, 1.5).
   - Move the door to the bottom left of the level.
     - Position its Y so that the midpoint of the Door approximately aligns with the midpoint of the HoverGuy (at the height we would want it to spawn).

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EjVJkZ4.gif" width=300px />

 - Move the sprite for the top into position, then vertex snap the bottom.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SF57oFs.gif" width=150px />

 - Create a prefab Assets/Prefabs/**HoverGuy** and delete the GameObject.
 - Select the Door and add **Spawner**:
   - Thing to spawn: HoverGuy

<br>**Test**:

 - A HoverGuy should spawn in instantly.  It'll stand there above the ground kicking its feet, but not moving.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>How do you know what size to make the second collider?</summary>

It does not matter much.  This second collider's only purpose is to ensure that the HoverGuy hovers above the ground.  So in a sense, we only need a single pixel to represent the correct Y position for Unity physics to use -- represented by the bottom of this circle collider.

Unity physics by default uses discrete collisions instead of continuous. 

 - Discrete means that each FixedUpdate, collisions are considered for the object's current position.
 - Continues means that each FixedUpdate, collisions consider the entire path the object has taken since the last FixedUpdate.

Discrete is is the default because it is more performant.  However Discrete is also less accurate. 

When a collider is too small, collisions may be missed entirely as the object changes from a little above to a little below an obstacle. e.g. this is a common problem when shooting, bullets may start to travel through walls instead of hitting them.

The collider may also be too large, causing our HoverGuy to continue standing on a platform when they should have fallen off the edge.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why use a child GameObject instead of two colliders on the parent?</summary>

You could opt to do this using just one GameObject instead.

The second collider we added is configured to collide with platforms but not with the character or other entities. This allows it to prop up the HoverGuy, making it hover above the ground.

We don't want the 'feet' to collide with the character because later in the tutorial we will be adding ladders. While the HoverGuy is on a ladder, the character can walk underneath. If the feet could hit the character he may die unexpectedly.

We are using a child GameObject for the HoverGuy's feet in order to simplify future components.  Specifically we will be created a FloorDetector which will need to know which collider represents the bottom of the object. 

<hr></details>

## 5.2) Make the HoverGuy Walk

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/HoverGuySpawn.zip) | [Source after]()

Add a script to the HoverGuy to drive random walk movement.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Create WanderWalkController**:

 - Create script Code/Movement/**WanderWalkController**:

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(WalkMovement))]
public class WanderWalkController : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  float timeBeforeFirstWander = 10;

  [SerializeField]
  float minTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection = 1;

  [SerializeField]
  float maxTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection = 10;

  WalkMovement walkMovement;

  protected void Awake()
  {
    walkMovement = GetComponent<WalkMovement>();
  }

  protected void Start()
  {
    StartCoroutine(Wander());
  }

  IEnumerator Wander()
  {
    walkMovement.desiredWalkDirection = 1;
    if(timeBeforeFirstWander > 0) 
    {
      yield return new WaitForSeconds(timeBeforeFirstWander);
    } 

    while(true)
    {
      SelectARandomWalkDirection();
      float timeToSleep = UnityEngine.Random.Range(
        minTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection,
        maxTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection);
      yield return new WaitForSeconds(timeToSleep);
    }
  }

  void SelectARandomWalkDirection()
  {
    walkMovement.desiredWalkDirection
      = UnityEngine.Random.value <= .5f ? 1 : -1;
  }
}
```

 - Add **WanderWalkController** to the HoverGuy (it should automatically add WalkMovement as well).

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

WanderWalkController is a controller to drive the WalkMovement component, similar to how the PlayerController does.  

The PlayerController reads input from the keyboard (or controller) and feeds that to WalkMovement.  WanderWalkController uses RNG to effectively do the same, simulating holding the right or left button.

WanderWalkController will always request movement either left or right.  It starts by going right for a period of time and then chooses directions randomly.  You could extend this logic to have the HoverGuy occasionally stand in the same place for a moment before continuing on.

You can configure the walk speed by modifying the WalkMovement component's 'Walk Speed'.

Note that at the moment HoverGuys will walk right off the screen.  This will be addressed soon.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why not set desiredWalkDirection to a random value instead of 1 or -1?</summary>

You could, if it creates the experience you want in the game.  For example:

```csharp
walkMovement.desiredWalkDirection 
  = UnityEngine.Random.Range(-1, 1);
```

This call would achieve the goal of getting the HoverGuy to walk randomly in one direction or the other. desiredWalkDirection is a percent - so 1 means walk at full speed to the right and -1 is full speed to the left.  Using Random.Range will often give you a much smaller value (e.g. .1) and therefore the walk speed in game may appear too slow.

## 5.3) Don't Spawn on Top of the Character

[YouTube]() | [Source before]() | [Source after]()

Update the door so that it does not spawn if the character is too close.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Select the Door:
   - Add a **BoxCollider2D**:
     - Check 'Is Trigger'.
     - Size it to cover the entrance area.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Jq4rU93.png" width=300px />

 - Update Components/Controllers/**Spawner**:

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;

public class Spawner : PlayerDeathMonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  GameObject thingToSpawn;

  [SerializeField]
  float initialWaitTime = 2;

  [SerializeField]
  float minTimeBetweenSpawns = .5f;

  [SerializeField]
  float maxTimeBetweenSpawns = 10;
```

<hr></details>

```csharp  
  [SerializeField]
  ContactFilter2D contactFilter;

  Collider2D safeZoneCollider;

  Collider2D[] tempColliderList = new Collider2D[1];
  
  protected void Awake()
  {
    safeZoneCollider = GetComponent<Collider2D>();
  }
```

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
  protected void Start()
  {
    StartCoroutine(SpawnEnemies());
  }

  public override void OnPlayerDeath()
  {
    StopAllCoroutines();
    StartCoroutine(SpawnEnemies());
  }

  IEnumerator SpawnEnemies()
  {
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(initialWaitTime);

    while(true)
    {
```

<hr></details>

```csharp
      if(safeZoneCollider == null 
        || safeZoneCollider.OverlapCollider(contactFilter, tempColliderList) == 0)
      {
```

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
        Instantiate(
          thingToSpawn,
          transform.position,
          Quaternion.identity);
```

<hr></details>

```csharp
      }
```

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
      float sleepTime = UnityEngine.Random.Range(
        minTimeBetweenSpawns,
        maxTimeBetweenSpawns);
      yield return new WaitForSeconds(sleepTime);
    }
  }
}
```

<hr></details>

 - Select the EvilCloud and under the Spawner component:
   - Check Use Layer Mask
   - Layer Mask: Player

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9oHr63R.png" width=150px />

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

The collider we added defines the area to check for the character before allowing a spawn to happen.  We make this large enough to cover the entire entrance area so that there is never a HoverGuy which spawns in and instantly kills the character - leaving the player feeling cheated.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What does OverlapCollider do?</summary>

In script, we check for the character by using OverlapCollider.  This is an on-demand way to check for colliders in the area.  The contact filter filters results to only consider the character, so another HoverGuy in the area does not stop the spawner as well.  

We could have chosen to use OnTriggerEnter and OnTriggerExit instead - this approach was chosen both because it's simple and works well for this use case, and because it exposes us to multiple different techniques during this tutorial.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why use a contact filter instead of a tag or a layermask?</summary>

You could but it may change how we interact with Unity here.  OverlapCollider answers our question of if the character is in the area, and it accepts a ContactFilter2D.

ContactFilter2D may be used to filter results on various dimensions when making calls such as OverlapCollider.  LayerMask is the only one we are interested in here.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Does the Collision Matrix impact anything when using OverlapCollider?</summary>

No.  The collision matrix as defined under the Physics 2D settings only impacts the real-time collisions from Unity.  Calls such as OverlapCollider do not assume the same restrictions that may have been applied in the collision matrix.  This provides a lot of flexibility for different mechanics.

If you do want to use the same LayerMask as defined in the collision matrix, you can ask Unity for that with the following:

```csharp
LayerMask myLayerMask = Physics2D.GetLayerCollisionMask(gameObject.layer);
```

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why use a temp collider list?</summary>

For performance reasons, the OverlapCollider method from Unity takes an array and then adds data to it -- as opposed to returning an array with the data requested (as they do for calls such as GetComponents).  They do this because calls like this may occur frequently and the overhead of creating a new array each time may become a bottleneck.

We create the array once and then pass the same one every time we make the call to OverlapCollider.

For this component, we don't actually need the data itself.  We only want to know if any objects overlap or not.  For this reason, we never read anything from the tempColliderList -- we only consider the number of results (the return value for that method).

Unity also uses the array we pass in to define the max number of results it should discover.  That is why our temp array has a length of 1 and not 0.

## 5.4) Fade in Entities

[YouTube]() | [Source before]() | [Source after]()

Add a script to entities so they fade in before moving.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Create script Components/Life/**FadeInThenEnable**:

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;

public class FadeInThenEnable : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  float timeTillEnabled = 3;

  [SerializeField]
  MonoBehaviour[] componentsToEnable;

  protected void OnEnable()
  {
    StartCoroutine(FadeIn());
  }

  protected void OnDisable()
  {
    StopAllCoroutines();
  }

  IEnumerator FadeIn()
  {
    SpriteRenderer[] spriteList
      = gameObject.GetComponentsInChildren<SpriteRenderer>();

    float timePassed = 0;
    while(timePassed < timeTillEnabled)
    {
      float percentComplete = timePassed / timeTillEnabled; TODO squared
      SetAlpha(spriteList, percentComplete);

      yield return null;

      timePassed += Time.deltaTime;
    }

    SetAlpha(spriteList, 1);

    for(int i = 0; i < componentsToEnable.Length; i++)
    {
      MonoBehaviour component = componentsToEnable[i];
      component.enabled = true;
    }
  }

  void SetAlpha(
    SpriteRenderer[] spriteList,
    float alpha)
  {
    for(int i = 0; i < spriteList.Length; i++)
    {
      SpriteRenderer sprite = spriteList[i];
      Color originalColor = sprite.color;
      sprite.color = new Color(
        originalColor.r, 
        originalColor.g, 
        originalColor.b, 
        alpha);
    }
  }
}
```

 - Disable the character's PlayerController component.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5WtzPmv.png" width=300px />

 - Select the Character and add **FadeInThenEnable**:
   - Expand 'Components to Enable'.
   - Set 'Size' to 1 and then hit tab for the list to update.
   - Drag/drop the PlayerController into the list as 'Element 0'.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hrXMt1f.gif" width=300px />

 - Select the HoverGuy prefab:
   - Disable the WanderWalkController.
   - Add **FadeInThenEnable**:
     - Assign WanderWalkController to the Components to Enable list.
 - Select the Hammer prefab:
   - Add **FadeInThenEnable** (nothing needed in the to enable list).

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What does this do?</summary>

The FadeInThenEnable script smoothly transitions the alpha for all the sprites in that GameObject from 0 (hidden) to 1 (visible) and then enables the list of components configured.

FadeInThenEnable is added to the Character and we disable the PlayerController to prevent any input such as walk or jump until complete.

On the HoverGuy we disable wander movement until complete.

For the Hammer, we could disable the Hammer component (preventing pickup) but it is unnecessary since the character can't move.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What does StopAllCoroutines do?</summary>

StopAllCoroutines will stop any coroutines which were started by this script.  Coroutines in Unity are not running on a different thread, so nothing will be interrupted in that sense - however any coroutine which has yield returned and is expecting to be resumed will not be.

Coroutines are automatically stopped when a GameObject is Destroyed or SetActive(false) is called.  However disabling a component (and not the entire GameObject) does not automatically stop coroutines - which is why we do it explicitly OnDisable here.
