# 6) Death effects

## 2.11) Create a pattern for death effects

Create a pattern to use instead of destroying GameObjects directly, allowing an opportunity for objects to animate on death.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Create script Code/Components/Death/**DeathEffect**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(DeathEffectManager))]
public abstract class DeathEffect : MonoBehaviour
{
  public abstract float timeUntilObjectMayBeDestroyed
  { TODO change this to be the return param for play
    get;
  }

  public abstract void PlayDeathEffects();
}
```

 - Create script Code/Components/Death/**DeathEffectManager**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class DeathEffectManager : MonoBehaviour
{
  bool isInProcessOfDying;

  public static void PlayDeathEffectsThenDestroy(
    GameObject gameObject)
  {
    DeathEffectManager deathEffectManager
      = gameObject.GetComponent<DeathEffectManager>();

    if(deathEffectManager == null)
    {
      Destroy(gameObject);
      return;
    }

    deathEffectManager.PlayDeathEffectsThenDestroy();
  }

  void PlayDeathEffectsThenDestroy()
  {
    if(isInProcessOfDying)
    {
      return;
    }
    isInProcessOfDying = true;

    DeathEffect[] deathEffectList
      = gameObject.GetComponentsInChildren<DeathEffect>();

    float maxTimeUntilObjectMayBeDestroyed = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < deathEffectList.Length; i++)
    {
      DeathEffect deathEffect = deathEffectList[i];
      maxTimeUntilObjectMayBeDestroyed = Mathf.Max(
        maxTimeUntilObjectMayBeDestroyed,
        deathEffect.timeUntilObjectMayBeDestroyed);

      deathEffect.PlayDeathEffects();
    }

    Destroy(gameObject, maxTimeUntilObjectMayBeDestroyed);
  }
}
```

<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Nothing yet.

This is a pattern we will leverage a few times in this tutorial, starting with the next section.

When an entity dies in the game, we call DeathEffectManager.PlayDeathEffectsThenDestroy instead of the usual Unity Destroy method.

This allows us to defer the actual Destroy call, and to spawn an explosion or play an animation on the sprite as it dies.  Also it allows us to differentiate between a request to immediately destroy a GameObject (e.g. for a scene change) vs a death that should maybe animate and spawn an explosion.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why not just play effects OnDestroy()?</summary>

OnDestroy is called anytime the object is destroyed, but we only want the death effects to trigger in certain circumstances.  For example, when we quit back to the main menu, we do not want explosions spawning for character being destroyed while closing level 1.

This pattern was selected because:

 - It gives us easy control over when DeathEffects should be considered, vs promptly destroying the object.
 - It gracefully falls back to Destroy when there are no DeathEffects to play.
 - It allows for several separate DeathEffects to be combined, creating a new kind of effect.

As always, there are probably a thousand different ways you could achieve similar results.

</details>
<details><summary>Why is there a public method that 'should not be called directly'?</summary>

PlayDeathEffects() in the DeathEffect class has a public method with a comment saying it 'should not be called directly'.  So why is it public?

In order to support multiple DeathEffects and to be able to fallback gracefully when an object does not have one, we always start effects by calling the public static method in DeathEffectManager, PlayDeathEffectsThenDestroy.

Since DeathEffectManager is a class of its own, we would not be able to call a private or protected method in DeathEffect.

'internal' could be an option to consider, but typically when working in Unity you are working in a single project - therefore internal is effectively the same as public.

You might also consider using nested classes.  For simplicity in the tutorial, we're not using nested classes as they can be a bit confusing.  If you are familiar with this topic, briefly you could make DeathEffectsManager a class nested inside DeathEffect and then make PlayDeathEffects() private, and the rest pretty much works the same.

</details>
<details><summary>Why are you using Mathf and not System.Math?</summary>

Unity offers the UnityEngine.Mathf class to try and make some things a little easier.  Basically it's the same APIs which are offered from the standard System.Math class (which is also still available to use if you prefer).  The main difference is all of the APIs in Mathf are focused on the float data type, where the System.Math class often prefers double.  Most of the data you interact with in Unity is float.

</details>

<details><summary>What does GetComponentsInChildren do?</summary>

GetComponent returns a reference to the component (or script) which is the type specified or inherits from the type specified.

GetComponents returns an array with every matching component.

GetComponentInChildren returns one match, from this GameObject or one of its child GameObjects.

GetComponentsInChildren returns an array with every matching component from this GameObject and all of its children (and their children).

</details>

<details><summary>What's C# abstract do and how's it different from an interface?</summary>

In C#, abstract refers to a class which is incomplete and may not be instantiated directly.  In order to create an object, a sub class inherits from the abstract class and you can then instantiate the sub class.

The sub class has access to everything created in the parent class, similar to if you had copy pasted everything from the parent into the child.

```csharp
public abstract class MyParentClass
{
  public int points;
}

public class MySubClass : MyParentClass
{
  public void PrintPoints()
  {
    print(points);
  }
}
```

An abstract class may include an abstract method when the parent knows a method should exist, but not how it should be implemented.

```csharp
public abstract class MyParentClass
{
  public int points;

  public abstract void PrintPoints();
}

public class MySubClass : MyParentClass
{
  public override void PrintPoints()
  {
    print(points);
  }
}
```

This allows you to create an API that works with all sub classes of the parent.

```csharp
public void Print(MyParentClass a)
{
  a.PrintPoints();
}
```

Methods may also be virtual, meaning the parent has an implementation but the child my optionally extend or replace it.


```csharp
public abstract class MyParentClass
{
  public int points;

  public virtual void PrintPoints()
  {
    print(points);
  }
}

public class MySubClass : MyParentClass
{
  public override void PrintPoints()
  {
    print("You have... ");
    base.PrintPoints();
  }
}
```

In C#, an interface is similar to an abstract class that has no data or non-abstract methods (including virtual).  Interfaces are a way of defining a common API for classes to leverage.  The name of an interface always starts with "I", by convention.

```csharp
public interface IMyInterface
{
  void PrintPoints();
}

public class MyClass : IMyInterface
{
  public int points;

  public void PrintPoints()
  {
    print(points);
  }
}
```

Other methods can leverage an interface without knowing the class that implemented the method like we did with the abstract class.

```csharp
public void Print(IMyInterface a)
{
  a.PrintPoints();
}
```

## 2.12) Kill the player when he hits a ball

When the player comes in contact with a spiked ball, kill him!

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Create script Code/Utils/**LayerMaskExtensions**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public static class LayerMaskExtensions
{
  public static bool Includes(
    this LayerMask mask,
    int layer)
  {
    return (mask.value & (1 << layer)) > 0;
  }
}
```

 - Create script Code/Components/Death/**KillOnContactWith**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(Collider2D))]
public class KillOnContactWith : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  LayerMask layersToKill;

  protected void Start() {}

  protected void OnCollisionEnter2D(
    Collision2D collision)
  {
    ConsiderKilling(collision.gameObject);
  }

  protected void OnTriggerEnter2D(
    Collider2D collision)
  {
    ConsiderKilling(collision.gameObject);
  }

  void ConsiderKilling(
    GameObject gameObjectWeJustHit)
  {
    if(enabled == false)
    {
      return;
    }

    if(layersToKill.Includes(gameObjectWeJustHit.layer) == false)
    {
      return;
    }

    DeathEffectManager.PlayDeathEffectsThenDestroy(gameObjectWeJustHit);
  }
}
```

 - Under Project Settings -> Tags and Layers:
   - Add a layer for 'Player'.
 - Select the Character GameObject:
   - Change its Layer to Player.
     - When prompted, 'No, this object only'.
 - Select the SpikeBall prefab in Assets/Prefabs:
    - Add **KillOnContactWith**:
      - Update 'Layers To Kill' to Player.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/wrkb3eJ.png" width=300px />

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

We created a component to use on enemies which will initiate the death sequence for the Character anytime he touches one of the enemy colliders (both collisions and triggers).

Hit play to watch the player die:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gKEl8wE.gif" width=300px />

For now, to test again stop and hit play again.  We'll respawn the player later in the tutorial.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why check the layer instead of using the Collision Matrix?</summary>

Layers are defined per GameObject.  The GameObject we will be adding this script to, already have a layer defined to support other use cases.  This means that the KillOnContactWith component will get event calls for collisions with other objects such as the platforms.

In order to do this with a Collision Matrix, a child GameObject with its own Layer could be added to hold this component.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What is this '& 1 <<' black magic?</summary>

Bitwise operations... which are beyond the scope of this tutorial.  More specifically, this is 'bitwise and' and 'bit shifting' if you would like to read more about this.  Here is a [Stackoverflow post on the topic](http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/8715/how-do-i-use-layermasks.html).

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What is a C# extension method?</summary>

Extension methods are a way of adding additional methods to a class or struct you don't own.  In this example, Unity has a struct 'LayerMask'.  That struct does not offer an easy way to determine if a layer is part of that LayerMask.  Using extensions, we are able to create an 'Includes' method that then can be used as if Unity had written it for us.

This allows us to focus on intent and forget the gory details.  For example this statement:

```csharp
if((layersToKill.value & 1 << gameObjectWeJustHit.layer) > 0)
...
```

Can now be written like so, which should be easier for people to follow.

```csharp
if(layersToKill.Includes(gameObjectWeJustHit.layer))
...
```

</details>
<details><summary>Why is there an empty Start method and why check if enabled?</summary>

We will need the ability to disable this component later in the tutorial.

A disabled component will not get called for events such as Update.  However it does still receive some calls while disabled, including OnTriggerEnter. This is why we check if enabled vs depending on Unity to do that for us.

Unity only allows you to use the enable / disable feature if it detects that there is a method in the script which would be impacted.  We added an empty Start method to get the enable / disable feature since Unity does not enable enable by checking 'if(enabled)' in code.

## 2.13) Create an explosion prefab with sound effect

Create an explosion particle system and save it as a prefab.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Create an empty GameObject:
   - Name it "Explosion".
   - Add a **ParticleSystem**:
     - Set 'Renderer' Material: Default-Particle
     - Set 'Renderer' Max Particle Size: 1000

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/xkv8CJd.png" width=300px />

 - Back at the top of the Particle System component, set:
   - Looping: Off
   - Start Lifetime: 0.5
   - Start Size: 30
   - Scaling Mode: Local

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/qlmzCMy.png" width=300px />

 - Update the Transform scale to about (.05, .05, .05)
 - Enable Color over Lifetime, and then:
   - Click the color to open the Gradient editor.
   - Click above the color bar, about 1/5th in from the left - creating a keyframe.
   - Click on the top left keyframe, change Alpha to 0.  Do the same for the top right.
   - Click on the bottom left keyframe, change the color to Hex 'FFF3DD'.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/x7tYdUE.gif" width=300px />

 - Under 'Emission':
   - Rate over Time: 0
   - Click the '+' under 'Bursts' to create an entry, change
     - Min: 3
     - Max: 3

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/TPWUZjE.png" width=300px />


 - Add **AudioSource** to the GameObject:
   - Change the AudioClip.  We are using **Death**.

TODO change volume


 - Drag the Explosion GameObject into Assets/Prefabs.
 - Delete the Explosion GameObject.


 - Create script Components/Death/**SuicideIn**: 

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class SuicideIn : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  float timeTillDeath = 5;

  protected void Start()
  {
    StartCoroutine(CountdownToDeath());
  }

  IEnumerator CountdownToDeath()
  {
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(timeTillDeath);
    DeathEffectManager.PlayDeathEffectsThenDestroy(gameObject);
  }
}
```

 - Add **SuicideIn** to the Explosion prefab.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

We created a particle system to represent a simple explosion and added a sound effect to match.  The 'system' is just 3 particles which look a bit like clouds.  They scale and color overtime to create the effect.

Briefly, the rational for each change recommended above:

 - Set the material: the default may be broken due to a Unity Bug, we are simply selecting what should have been the default.
 - Particle Size: this limits the size of the effect you may see on the screen.  We crank it up so that while previewing the in Scene window we can zoom in.
 - Looping: just one explosion.
 - Start Lifetime: Defines how long until each particle should be destroyed.
 - Start Size: How large each particle is.
 - Scaling Mode: Enables us to scale the size of the explosion using Transform scale.
 - Color over Lifetime: Changes the coloring to add to the effect.
 - Emission: Defines when and how many particles to create.  We are using exactly 3 particles for each explosion.



<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's a particle / particle system?</summary>

A particle is a small 2D image managed by a particle system.  It's optimized to display a large number of similar particles at the same time, possible with different colors, sizes, etc.

A Particle System component animates a number of particles to create effects such as fluid, smoke, and fire. Read more about [Particle Systems from Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ParticleSystem.html).

</details>
<details><summary>Could you RNG select the audio clip to play?</summary>

Anything is possible.  Here's a little code sample that may help you get started.

On a related note, you could also randomize the pitch to get some variation between each clip played.  e.g. this could be a nice addition to a rapidly firing gun.

```csharp
[SerializeField]
AudioClip clip1;
[SerializeField]
AudioClip clip2;

protected void OnEnable()
{
  AudioSource audioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();
  switch(UnityEngine.Random.Range(0, 2))
  {
    case 0:
    audioSource.clip = clip1;
    break;
    case 1:
    audioSource.clip = clip2;
    break;
  }
  audioSource.Play();
}
```

</details>

## 2.14) Spawn and destroy explosions

Add a script which spawns the explosion prefab when the character dies.  The explosion should Destroy after a few the effect completes.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Create script Components/Death/**DeathEffectSpawn**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(Collider2D))]
public class DeathEffectSpawn : DeathEffect
{
  [SerializeField]
  GameObject gameObjectToSpawnOnDeath;

  public override float timeUntilObjectMayBeDestroyed
  {
    get
    {
      return 0;
    }
  }

  public override void PlayDeathEffects()
  {
    Collider2D collider = GetComponent<Collider2D>();

    Instantiate(
      gameObjectToSpawnOnDeath,
      collider.bounds.center,
      Quaternion.identity);
  }
}
```

 - Add **DeathEffectSpawn** to the character (this will automatically add a **DeathEffectManager** as well).
   - Assign the Explosion prefab to 'Game Object To Spawn'.


<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

DeathEffectSpawn will spawn in another GameObject when the entity it's on dies.  In this case, we spawn the explosion when the character dies:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/XhhkRpC.gif" width=150px />

This component starts DeathEffects for a GameObject, which in turn will destroy the GameObject, after a period of time.  We use it on the explosion to prevent a memory leak by deleting it's GameObject after the explosion itself is no longer visible.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's bounds represent?</summary>

The Unity Bounds struct represents the axis aligned bounding box for the collider.  This means if you were to contain the collider in a cube which cannot be rotated - what is the position and size of the smallest possible surrounding cube.

For 2D, the Bounds struct still has a z but it will be 0 and everything else will work as expected.

Unity has a number of APIs available for bounds.  Here we are using .center, which represents the center of the collider which may differ from the transform position - particularly for the character since the pivot point is Bottom.

</details>
<details><summary>Why not spawn the explosion at transform.position instead of bounds.center?</summary>

The character sprite was configured with Pivot 'Bottom'.  The transform.position refers to the location of this pivot point.  If we were to target transform.position instead, the explosion would center around the character's feet.

This component could be reused on other GameObjects which may have a different pivot point. It will work correctly so long as the object has a collider.

We use the collider's bounds to determine where to spawn the explosion.  The [bounds struct](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Bounds.html) has a number of convenient methods for things like determining the center point of an object.

</details>
<details><summary>Why bother destroying, the explosion is not visible after a few seconds?</summary>

Similar to how we destroyed balls which rolled off the bottom of the screen in chapter 1, we need to ensure the explosion GameObjects are destroyed at some point.

The explosion effect on screen only lasts for a few seconds, but Unity does not realize this on its own.  Destroying the GameObject prevents Unity from wasting resources on the old GameObjects which are never going to be visible again.

In other words, this script ensures that our explosions do not result in a memory leak.

</details>


## 2.17) Animate characters death

Add a scaling effect for the character dying, in addition to the explosion.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Create script Components/Death/**DeathEffectThrob**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class DeathEffectThrob : DeathEffect
{
  [SerializeField]
  float lengthOfEffectInSeconds = 1;

  [SerializeField]
  int numberOfPulses = 5;

  public override float timeUntilObjectMayBeDestroyed
  {
    get
    {
      return lengthOfEffectInSeconds;
    }
  }

  public override void PlayDeathEffects()
  {
    StartCoroutine(ThrobToDeath());
  }

  IEnumerator ThrobToDeath()
  {
    float timePerPulse
      = lengthOfEffectInSeconds / numberOfPulses;
    float timeRun = 0;
    while(timeRun < lengthOfEffectInSeconds)
    {
      float percentComplete
        = timeRun / lengthOfEffectInSeconds;
      float sinValue
        = Mathf.Sin(Mathf.PI * timeRun / timePerPulse);
      float pulse = .5f + Mathf.Abs(sinValue);
      float scale = (1 - percentComplete) * pulse;
      gameObject.transform.localScale
        = Vector3.one * scale; TODO change to use original scale

      yield return null;
      timeRun += Time.deltaTime;
    }

    Destroy(gameObject);
  }
}
```

 - Add **DeathEffectThrob** to the Character.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

When the DeathEffects for an entity are initiated, this component will scale the sprite up and down while shrinking it overall until it's gone.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gSJtJRd.gif" width=300px />

<hr></details>

<details><summary>What does yield return null do?</summary>

Enumerators are methods which can 'yield return' and then later be resumed from where they left off.  Coroutines in Unity are enumerators.

With Coroutines, "yield return null" is shorthand for wait for one frame.

Each of these accomplishes the same, the coroutine resumes on the next Update:

```csharp
yield return null; // Preferred
yield return new WaitForSeconds(0); // Same, but longer
yield return 0; // Less efficient
```

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why not use an animation instead?</summary>

You could.  There are numerous ways to create animations and effects - in this tutorial we cover a few different approaches just for the experience.

We will be introducing Unity 'animations' later in this tutorial.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why use Mathf.Sin?</summary>

Sin is used frequently in game dev because of the nice curve it creates:

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Sine_one_period.svg" width=300px />

We will be taking the absolute value, so the curve from 0 to Pi repeats over and over.  The result oscillates smoothly between 0 and 1.

We add .5 to the result, giving us .5 -> 1.5.  That's used as a multiple when scaling, creating the throb effect.

More about how you can use [Sin and Cos to create nice curves from OSU.edu](https://accad.osu.edu/~aprice/courses/694/Sin_fun.htm).

<hr></details>
<details><summary>How might we disable movement when the character is dying?</summary>

After the character dies and the throb animation begins, you can still walk around.  This could be addressed, but we are leaving it like this for the tutorial for simplicity and because it's kind of funny looking.

To stop movement, you could disable the PlayerController or the Rigidbody.  You might also want to stop the current animation as well.

<hr></details>






## 2.18) Test!

Chapter 2, complete!  Your game should now look a lot like the gif at the top.  You can compare to our  [demo build](https://hardlydifficult.com/PlatformerTutorialPart2/index.html) and review the [Unity Project / Source Code for Chapter 2](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/Unity2DPlatformerTutorial/tree/Part2). TODO links

Additionally to review, you may want to:
 - Consider sorting components on the character GameObject, as it's starting to look a little cluttered.
 - Try adjusting the jump speed for the character.
 - Maybe try different particle systems for the explosion death effect.
 - Cut a test build and try it outside of the Unity editor environment.

<details><summary>How do you sort components on a GameObject?</summary>

The order does not impact anything.  So why bother?  Just tidiness really.   As the number of components grows it may be nice to have them presented in an order you find more intuitive.

Start by collapsing everything.
To sort, select the GameObject and in the Inspector

Transform has to be first. Then Unity stuff.  Then scripts.

Unity grouping logically similar components, eg. Rigidbody near Collider

Scripts in order where possible, like DeathEffectManager before any DeathEffects.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ElAr8xt.gif" width=150px />

On a related note, order does matter when for some scripts in terms of which component executes before another.  To ma... Script execution order
