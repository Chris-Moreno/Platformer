# 2) Character

Basic animations, player controller, effector, particle system

In chapter 2, we add a character to the scene.  He can walk and jump, and dies when hitting an enemy, creating a basic platformer.

This assumes you completed chapter 1, or you can download the project so far. (TODO link)

## 2.2) Create an animated character

Add a GameObject for the character with a walk animation. Change the order in layer to 2.

<details><summary>How</summary>

Change the character's pivot point:

 - Select all the character sprites, we are using **adventurer_tilesheet_TODO**.
 - In the Inspector, change 'Pivot' to 'Bottom'.

<br>Create character:

 - Hold Ctrl to select both **adventurer_tilesheet_9** and **10**.
   - Drag them into the Hierarchy. TODO change to drop in scene.
   - When prompted, save the animation as Assets/Animations/**CharacterWalk**.anim

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jPvFvnq.gif" width=300px />

 - Select the GameObject just created:
   - Order in Layer: 2
 - Create an empty parent GameObject named "Character":
   - Add the sprite GameObject as a child.

<br>Add a collider:

 - Select the Character parent GameObject:
   - Add a **Rigidbody2D**.
     - Expand the 'Constraints' and Check 'Freeze Rotation: Z'.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/uXxDSwD.png" width=300px />

   - Add a **CapsuleCollider2D** to the Character:
     - Click 'Edit Collider' and adjust to fit the character. You can click and then hold Alt while adjusting the sides to pull both sides in evenly.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KFwBZeo.gif" width=150px />


<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

For the character, we are moving the pivot point to the 'Bottom'.  This allows us to position and rotate the character starting at the feet instead of the center of his body.


Dragging multiple sprites into the Hierarchy created:
 - The character's GameObject.
 - A SpriteRenderer component on the GameObject defaulting to the first selected sprite.
 - An Animation representing those 2 sprites changing over time.
 - An Animator Controller for the character with a default state for the Walk animation.
 - An Animator component on the GameObject configured for the Animator Controller just created.

The order in layer ensures that the character appears on top of other sprites such as platforms when jumping.

We add the sprite to a parent Character GameObject so that any animations we create do not impact other things that may be attached to the Character.  Specifically is this tutorial this ensures that the hammer we equip is not impacted by the idle animation we will be creating.

Click Play to test - your character should be walking (in place)!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2bkJdtS.gif" width=100px />

<br>Add a collider:

The rigidbody and collider enable physics for the character.  We size the collider to be used for standing on platforms, colliding with enemies, and picking up items.

Add a constraint to the character's rigidbody to freeze its rotation.
The character shouldn't fall over anymore.  In fact he will stand straight up even on slanted platforms.  This will be addressed later in the tutorial.


<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's Pivot do?</summary>

A pivot point is the main anchor point for the sprite.  By default, pivot points are at the center of the sprite.

Here's an example showing a character with a default 'Center' pivot and one with the recommended 'Bottom' pivot.  They both have the same Y position.  Notice the the vertical position of each character as well as how the rotation centers around the different pivot points:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AQY4FOT.gif" width=320 />

The pivot point you select is going to impact how we create animations and implement movement mechanics.  The significance of this topic should become more clear later in the tutorial.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's the difference between Animation and Animator?</summary>

An animat**ion** is a collection of sprites on a timeline, creating an animated effect similar to a flip book.  Animations can also include transform changes, fire events for scripts to react to, etc to create any number of effects.

An animat**or** controls which animations should be played at any given time.  An animator uses an animator controller which is a state machine used to select animations.

A state machine is a common pattern in development where logic is split across several states.  The state machine selects one primary state which owns the experience until the state machine transitions to another state.  Each animator state has an associated animation to play.  When you transition from one state to another, Unity switches from one animation to the next.

We will be diving into more detail about animations and animators later in the tutorial.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>How do I know what size to make the collider?</summary>

The collider does not fit the character perfectly, and that's okay.  In order for the game to feel fair for the player we should lean in their favor.  When designing colliders for the character and enemies, we may prefer to make the colliders a little smaller than the sprite so that there are no collisions in game which may leave the player feeling cheated.

As the character animates, its limbs may be in different positions.  The collider won't always fit the character and for that reason we use a collider focused around the body.

In addition to killing the character when he comes in contact with an enemy, the collider is used to keep the character on top of platforms.  For this reason it's important that the bottom of the collider aligns with the sprite's feet.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why not use a collider that outlines the character?</summary>

Bottom line, it's not worth the trouble.  Unity does not provide good tools for more accurate collisions on animating sprites.  Implementing this requires a lot of considerations and may be difficult to debug.

Most of the time the collisions in the game would not have been any different if more detailed colliders were used.  Typically 2D games use an approach similar to what this tutorial recommends. It creates a good game feel and the simplifications taken have become industry standard.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why freeze rotation and does freezing mean it can never change?</summary>

We freeze the character so he does not fall over on the slanted platforms like this:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/T0fdwa1.gif" width=150px />

Adding constraints to the rigidbody only limits the Unity physics engine. Freezing the rigidbody position or rotation means that even if you got hit by a bus, you would not move or rotate.  However you could have a custom component set the position or rotation at any time.

Later in the tutorial we will be writing a script to rotate entities so that they align with platforms (i.e. their feet sit flat on the floor).

We use constraints to remove capabilities from Unity, allowing us more control where we need it.  Specifically here that means our character is not going to ever fall flat on his face.

<hr></details>


## 2.5) Add a script to move left & right

Add a script to the character to be able to move left and right once a controller is added.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Create script Code/Components/Movement/**WalkMovement**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System;

[RequireComponent(typeof(Rigidbody2D))]
public class WalkMovement : MonoBehaviour
{
  TODO change all nonserialized to HideInInspector
  [NonSerialized]
  public float desiredWalkDirection;

  [SerializeField]
  float walkSpeed = 100;

  Rigidbody2D myBody;

  protected void Awake()
  {
    myBody = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
  }

  protected void FixedUpdate()
  {
    float desiredXVelocity
      = desiredWalkDirection
        * walkSpeed
        * Time.fixedDeltaTime;

    myBody.velocity = new Vector2(
      desiredXVelocity,
      myBody.velocity.y);
  }
}
```

 - Add **WalkMovement** to the Character.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Nothing yet.  This script enables movement, but requires a separate controller to function.

A controller (created in the next section) will set the desiredWalkDirection, then every FixedUpdate WalkMovement turn that into horizontal velocity on the rigidbody while preserving any vertical velocity (so not to interfere with gravity).

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's a controller?  Why not read input here?</summary>

As discussed in chapter 1, Unity encourages a component based solution.  This means that we attempt to make each component focused on a single mechanic or feature.  Doing so simplifies debugging and enables reuse.  For example, we will be creating another enemy type which will use the same WalkMovement component created for the character above.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why set velocity instead of using AddForce?</summary>

AddForce is a way of impacting a rigidbody's velocity indirectly.  Anytime you interact with either AddForce or velocity, a similar mechanic could be made using the other.

Generally the game feel when using AddForce has more gradual changes and for many experiences that's great.  Although there are lots of options for tuning the forces experience, velocity simply gives you more direct control.

So that's to say you could use AddForce here instead.  Maybe give it a try and see how it feels.  We select velocity because we want the controls for moving left and right to feel crisp.  Later in the tutorial we will use AddForce, for the jump effect.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why FixedUpdate instead of Update?</summary>

Update occurs once per rendered frame.  FixedUpdate occurs at a regular interval, every x ms of game time.  FixedUpdate may run 0 or more times each frame.

FixedUpdate is preferred for mechanics which require some level of consistency or apply changes incrementally.  Physics in Unity are processed in FixedUpdated.  So when manipulating physics for the game such as we are here by changing velocity on the rigidbody, we do this on FixedUpdate to match Unity's expectations.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why multiply by Time.fixedDeltaTime?</summary>

It's optional. Anytime you make a change which includes some speed, such as walking, we multiply by the time elapsed so motion is smooth even when the frame rate may not be.  While using FixedUpdate, the time passed between calls is always the same - so Time.fixedDeltaTime is essentially a constant.

If speed is being processed in an Update, you must multiply by Time.deltaTime for a smooth experience.  While in FixedUpdate, you could opt to not use Time.fixedDeltaTime, however leaving it out may lead to some confusion as fields which are configured for FixedUpdate may have a different order of magnitude than fields configured for use in Update.

Additionally you may choose to adjust the time interval between FixedUpdate calls while optimizing your game.  By consistently multiplying by the delta time, you can adjust the interval for FixedUpdate without changing the game play.

<hr></details>



## 2.6) Add a player controller (TODO maybe merge up)

Add a script to the character to read user input and drive movement.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Create script Code/Components/Movement/**PlayerController**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(WalkMovement))]
public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
  WalkMovement walkMovement;

  protected void Awake()
  {
    walkMovement = GetComponent<WalkMovement>();
  }

  protected void FixedUpdate()
  {
    walkMovement.desiredWalkDirection
      = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
  }
}
```

 - Add **PlayerController** to the Character.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

The character should walk around (use arrow keys or WASD), but there is clearly work to be done:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xOpivgJ.gif" />

Note the character will always be looking right, even while walking left.  He can also walk off the screen and push the balls around.  This will all be addressed later in the tutorial.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What is an Input 'Axis' and how are they configured?</summary>

Unity offers several ways of detecting keyboard/mouse/controller input.  'Axis' is the recommended approach.  Each input Axis may be configured in the inspector:

 - Edit -> Project Settings -> Input.
 - In the 'Inspector', you will find a list of supported input types.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/T2BJvBm.png" width=100px />

You can add, remove, rename, and configure the inputs for your game.  Inputs may also be reconfigured by the player at runtime.  For more information about the various options, see [Unity's description of the InputManager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html).  We will be using the defaults for this tutorial.

To read / detect Input, Unity offers a few APIs including:

 - GetAxis: Gets the current state as a float.  E.g. horizontal may return 1 for right, -1 for left.
 - GetButtonDown/GetButtonUp: Determines if a button was pressed or released this frame.
 - GetMouseButtonDown/GetMouseButtonUp: Same as above, but for mouse buttons.

There are a ton of options, check out the [complete list of Input APIs](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.html).

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why not use a bool or Enum for Left/Right instead of a float?</summary>

You could for the game we are making at the moment.  When playing with a keyboard, a button is down or it isn't.

The nice thing about using a float here is it could be leveraged to allow players even more control over movement.  When playing with a controller, left and right are not simply on and off - the amount you move the joystick  by scales how quickly the character should walk.

The WalkMovement desiredWalkDirection should be set to something in the range of -1 to 1, where 1 represents the desire to walk at full speed towards the right.  From there the WalkMovement component will apply the walkSpeed, representing the fastest speed the entity should walk, and then update the rigidbody.

<hr></details>

## 4.1) Flip entities when they walk the other way

Flip the entity when they switch between walking left and right.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Create script Components/Movement/**FlipFacingDirection**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(Rigidbody2D))]
public class FlipFacingDirection : MonoBehaviour
{
  Rigidbody2D myBody;

  SpriteRenderer sprite;
  
  bool _isGoingLeft;

  public bool isGoingLeft
  {
    get
    {
      return _isGoingLeft;
    }
    private set
    {
      if(isGoingLeft == value)
      {
        return;
      }

      _isGoingLeft = value;
      sprite.flipX = isGoingLeft;
    }
  }

  protected void Awake()
  {
    myBody = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
    sprite = GetComponentInChildren<SpriteRenderer>();
  }

  protected void FixedUpdate()
  {
    float xVelocity = myBody.velocity.x;
    if(Mathf.Abs(xVelocity) > 0.1)
    {
      isGoingLeft = xVelocity < 0;
    }
  }
}
```

 - Add **FlipFacingDirection** to the character prefab.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Each FixedUpdate, we determine which direction the entity is walking by its X velocity.  When the direction changes, we flip the sprite so that the character appears to be facing the other way.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's a C# smart property?</summary>

In C#, data may be exposed as either a Field or a Property.  Fields are simply data as one would expect.  Properties are accessed in code like a field is, but they are capable of more.

In this example, when isGoingRight changes between true and false, the GameObject's transform is rotated so that the sprite faces the correct direction.  Leveraging the property changing to trigger the rotation change is an example of logic in the property making it 'smart'.

There are pros and cons to smart properties.  For example, one may argue that including the transform change when isGoingRight is modified hides the mechanic and makes the code harder to follow.  There are always alternatives if you prefer to not use smart properties.  For example:

```csharp
bool isGoingLeftNow = xVelocity <> 0;
if(isGoingLeft != isGoingLeftNow) 
{
  sprite.flipX = isGoingLeft;
  isGoingLeft = isGoingLeftNow;
}
```

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why not compare to 0 when checking if there is no movement?</summary>

In Unity, numbers are represented with the float data type.  Float is a way of representing decimal numbers but is a not precise representation like you may expect.  When you set a float to some value, internally it may be rounded ever so slightly.

The rounding that happens with floats allows operations on floats to be executed very quickly.  However it means we should never look for exact values when comparing floats, as a tiny rounding issue may lead to the numbers not being equal.

In the example above, as the velocity approaches zero, the significance of if the value is positive or negative, is lost.  It's possible that if we were to compare to 0 that at times the float may oscillate between a tiny negative value and a tiny positive value causing the sprite to flip back and forth.

<hr></details>

## 2.7) Jump

Add a script to the character to be able to jump and update the player controller to match.  Play a sound effect when an entity jumps.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Create script Code/Components/Movement/**JumpMovement**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(Rigidbody2D))]
[RequireComponent(typeof(AudioSource))]
public class JumpMovement : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  AudioClip jumpSound;

  [SerializeField]
  float jumpSpeed = 7f;

  Rigidbody2D myBody;

  AudioSource audioSource;

  bool wasJumpRequestedSinceLastFixedUpdate;

  protected void Awake()
  {
    myBody = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
    audioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>(); // TODO is audioSource and jumpClip optional or required?
  }

  public void Jump()
  {
    wasJumpRequestedSinceLastFixedUpdate = true;
  }

  protected void FixedUpdate()
  {
    if(wasJumpRequestedSinceLastFixedUpdate)
    {
      myBody.AddForce(
          new Vector2(0, jumpSpeed),
          ForceMode2D.Impulse);

      audioSource.PlayOneShot(jumpSound);
    }

    wasJumpRequestedSinceLastFixedUpdate = false;
  }
}
```

 - Add **JumpMovement** to the Character (this will automatically add an **AudioSource**):
   - Select the Jump Sound.  We are using **Jump**.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/I5JWg9s.gif" width=300px />

 - Update Code/Components/Controllers/**PlayerController**. by adding the code below:

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(WalkMovement))]
```

<hr></details>

```csharp
[RequireComponent(typeof(JumpMovement))]
```

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
  WalkMovement walkMovement;
```

<hr></details>

```csharp
  JumpMovement jumpMovement;
```

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
  protected void Awake()
  {
    walkMovement = GetComponent<WalkMovement>();
```

<hr></details>

```csharp
    jumpMovement = GetComponent<JumpMovement>();
```

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
  }

  protected void FixedUpdate()
  {
    walkMovement.desiredWalkDirection
      = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
  }
```

<hr></details>

```csharp
  protected void Update()
  {
    if(Input.GetButtonDown("Jump"))
    {
      jumpMovement.Jump();
    }
  }
```

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
}
```

<hr></details>


<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

When you press space, JumpMovement adds force to the entity causing it to jump up.  But you can spam the space bar to fly away.

A sound should play every time you jump, you can adjust the volume in the AudioSource component.

Like with walking, we use two separate components for this mechanic. JumpMovement enables the actual jump itself, allowing it to be used on another entity if we choose, and the PlayerController reads input in order to initiate jumps.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why AddForce here instead of velocity and what's 'Impulse'?</summary>

As discussed above when creating the WalkMovement component, you could always create mechanics using either AddForce or by modifying the velocity.

We are using AddForce to jump in this component.  Using velocity here instead would have actually created the same basic jump experience we are looking for.

Using AddForce for the jump may provide a better experience for some corner cases or future mechanics.  For example, if we wanted to support double jump in this game, initiating the second jump while in the air would feel much different.

What is ForceMode2D.Impulse and how is it different from ForceMode2D.Force?

These options have very similar effects on objects, the biggest difference is the scale (i.e. how much motion X creates when Impulse vs Force).   The unit for Impulse is defined as force per FixedUpdate.  The unit for Force is defined as force per second.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>How do you know when to use Update vs FixedUpdate for Input and rigidbodies?</summary>

Unity recommends always using FixedUpdate when interacting with a rigidbody as physics is processed in FixedUpdate.

There is nothing blocking you from changing the rigidbody in an Update loop.  You could, for example, AddForce every Update.  This is not recommended and may lead to inconsistent experiences.

For Input:

 - When reading the current Input state (e.g. using Input.GetAxis), either FixedUpdate or Update is fine.  For example if you are checking the current position of the joystick, you'll get the same information in FixedUpdate and Update.
  - If you need to modify a rigidbody based on current Input state, I recommend reading Input in FixedUpdate to keep it simple.
 - When checking for an Input event (e.g. using Input.GetButtonDown), you must use Update.  Input is polled in the Update loop.  Since it's possible for two Updates to happen before a FixedUpdate, some events may be missed when only checking in FixedUpdate.
   - Always read events in Update.  Unity will not block or warn you when checking for an event in FixedUpdate, and most of the time it will work - but occasional bugs will arise.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why is AudioSource on a GameObject vs just playing clips?</summary>

Audio playback in Unity is built to support 3D audio.  3D audio refers to the feature where the closer an object making noise is to your ear, the louder it is.  Additionally 3D sound is directional, so sounds to the players left would be loudest in the left speaker.

TODO 2D is left and right channels.  3D adds distance.

Your 'ear' is typically the camera itself.  This is managed by the AudioListener component which was placed on the Main Camera by default when the scene was created.  You could choose to move this component to the character instead, if appropriate.

To enable 3D audio, sounds need to originate at a position in the world.  We use the AudioSource component to play clips.  As a component, it must live an a GameObject which in turn must have a Transform -- the position we are looking for.

For consistency, 2D audio is played the same way.  2D means we don't have the features above, the clip sounds the same regardless of where it the world it was initiated from.  Note that audio is 2D by default.

Alternatively you could use the Unity API to play a clip as shown below.  This API will create an empty GameObject at the location provided, add an AudioSource component to it, configure that source to use the clip specified and have the AudioSource start playing.  After the clip completes, the GameObject will be destroyed automatically.

```csharp
[SerializeField]
AudioClip clip;

protected void Start()
{
  AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint(clip, new Vector3(5, 1, 2));
}
```

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Would two separate player controllers be a better component based solution?</summary>

Maybe, but it feels like overkill.  The value of separating components is to allow us to mix and match to create new experiences.  In this tutorial, we have no use case for using one or the other player controller mechanic (i.e. just support walking or just support jumping).

<hr></details>

## TODO Platform effectors


<br>Add a PlatformerEffector2D to each platform:

 - Select all of the Platform GameObjects.
   - Add **PlatformEffector2D**.
     - Change the 'Surface Arc' to '35'.
   - Under the BoxCollider2D, select 'Use by Effector'.

   
<br>Add a PlatformerEffector2D to each platform:


The PlatformerEffector2D creates one-way collisions for our platforms.  This allows entities to jump through a platform and land on top -- a common mechanic for platformer games.

Reduce the PlatformerEffector2D Surface Arc disables collisions on the sides of the platforms, preventing the character from sticking to the side in a strange way.


<details><summary>What are Effectors?</summary>

Effectors in Unity are easy ways to add various mechanics to the game.  The one-way collision effect we are using here happens to be a very common mechanic for 2D games, so Unity has this component ready to drop in.  

Unity is not doing anything with these components that you technically could not have built yourself in a custom script, but that said adding the one-way effect the PlatformerEffector2D creates would not be easy to do.

Read more about the [various 2d effectors in Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Effectors2D.html) including a conveyor belt, repulsion, and floating effects.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What does Surface Arc do and why not use a value of 1?</summary>

The surface arc for an effector changes the supported region, in this case the surfaces which are collidable.  By reducing this we are causing the sides to be treated as non-collidable like the bottoms are by default. 

The surface arc is defined in degrees around the Transform's up direction, and compared against the normal of the surface of the collider at the point of collision to determine if effects apply (in this case, if collisions apply).

A very small surface arc still allows the primary use case to work correctly, i.e. you can still stand on platforms.  The sides, where a rounded edge appears, may not be collidable causing the character to fall off prematurely.  

You can adjust the surface arc to find a value that feels good.
