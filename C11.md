## 5.4) Character animation parameters

Create parameters to use in the character's Animator Controller and a script to feed the data.

<details><summary>How</summary>

Create animation parameters:

 - Open menu Window -> Animator.
   - Select the character's child sprite GameObject.
   - Switch to the 'Parameters' tab on the left.
   - Click the '+' button and select 'Float'.

 - Name the parameter "Speed".
 - Repeat to create:
   - A bool named 'isTouchingFloor'.
   - A bool named 'isClimbing'.
   - A bool named 'hasWeapon'.


 - In the Animator for the character, select the 'CharacterWalk' state (the orange box).
   - In the Inspector:
     - Adjust the 'Speed' to about '.4'
     - Check the box near 'Multiplier' to enable a 'Parameter'.
       - Confirm Speed is selected (should be the default).

<br>Have the Character sync animation parameters:

 - Create script Components/Animations/**PlayerAnimatorController**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(Rigidbody2D))]
[RequireComponent(typeof(LadderMovement))]
[RequireComponent(typeof(WeaponHolder))]
public class PlayerAnimatorController : MonoBehaviour
{
  Animator animator;

  Rigidbody2D myBody;

  LadderMovement ladderMovement;

  FloorDetector floorDetector;

  WeaponHolder weaponHolder;

  protected void Awake()
  {
    animator = GetComponentInChildren<Animator>();
    myBody = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
    ladderMovement = GetComponent<LadderMovement>();
    floorDetector = GetComponentInChildren<FloorDetector>();
    weaponHolder = GetComponent<WeaponHolder>();
  }

  protected void Update() TODO late update
  {
    animator.SetFloat("Speed", myBody.velocity.magnitude);
    animator.SetBool("isTouchingFloor", floorDetector.isTouchingFloor);
    animator.SetBool("isClimbing", ladderMovement.isOnLadder);
    animator.SetBool("hasWeapon", weaponHolder.currentWeapon != null);
  }
}
```

 - Add **PlayerAnimatorController** to the Character.

<details><summary>What did that do</summary>

<br>Create animation parameters:

The parameters we are creating will be used to cause the Animator controller to transition from one state to another.  This approach is an alternative to playing the animation state directly like we had done for the Hammer above.  

The speed parameter will also be used to scale the animation playback speed based off how quickly the entity is moving at the time.

<br>Walk speed

This slows the character's walk animation and gradually turns it on and off as the character starts and stops moving.

Now the character's walk animation should align with the moment a little better.  Adjust the value to something you think looks good. However the walk animation also plays while jumping, we'll address this next.

<br>Have the Character sync animation parameters:

The PlayerAnimatorController is simply forwarding information from various components to the Animator controller.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>When do you use Animator Controller parameters vs Play(state) to change animations?</summary>

It's up to you.  Both approaches have the same capabilities, but by using animation parameters you can let the Animator Controller own much of the logic - simplifying your code and debugging.

I prefer to use Play for simple objects like the Hammer, and use animation parameters for more complex ones like entities.

You can also use a combination of the two approaches.  Calling Play will change the current Animator State, and from there any transitions from that state will be considered.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why LateUpdate instead of Update or FixedUpdate?<summary>

TODO

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What unit/scale is speed defined in?</summary>

Percent.  1 represents the speed as it was defined in the animation itself.  Going to 2 would double the playback speed, going to .5 would cut the playback speed in half.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>How does the Multiplier Parameter work?</summary>

Various settings for the animator state may be modified with one of the parameters we define in the Animator Controller.  Here we are using speed with a default value of .4.  When the animation is playing, the animation playback speed is multiplied by the Speed parameter (which is the velocity magnitude) - so if we are not moving the animation actually pauses, and it slows down / speeds up with our movement.

## 5.7) Jump animation

Add an animation to the character for jumping. 

<details><summary>How</summary>

Jump animation:

 - Select the character's sprite and in the Animation window, create a new clip Animations/**CharacterJump**:
   - Select the sprites for the jump animation. We are using **adverturer_spritesheet_7** and **8**.
   - Drag and drop the sprites onto the Animation timeline.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0rHCGDm.gif" width=300px />

 - In the Animator window:
   - Select the CharacterJump state:
     - Speed: .05
     - Check to use the Speed Multiplier Parameter: 'Speed'

<br>Transition to jump:

   - Right click on the 'Any State' box and select 'Make Transition'.
     - An arrow will follow your mouse, click on the CharacterJump state to create the transition.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Fl0WTPO.gif" width=300px />

 - Select the transition arrow just created, in the Inspector click the plus to create a new condition.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WgOfzQY.png" width=150px />

 - Change the condition to read 'isTouchingFloor false'.
 - Under 'Settings':
   - Transition Duration: 0
   - Uncheck 'Can Transition to Self'
 - Create a transition from CharacterJump to CharacterWalk.
 - Select the transition just created:
   - Add a condition: isTouchingFloor true
   - Uncheck 'Has Exit Time'
   - Transition Duration: 0

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Jump animation:

A jump animation for the character was added which simply kicks his feet.  By default this is way to fast, we slow it down and multiply by the entity's current speed.

<br>Transition to jump:

As you jump, the character should kick his feet a bit and then resume walking when he lands.  We do this with Transitions in the Animator Controller.  These transitions are driven by conditions, checking the parameters we have populated with the PlayerAnimatorController.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why transition from Any State instead of from CharacterWalk?</summary>

Any State is a special 'state' in the Animator Controller, allowing you to define transitions which could happen at any time.

You could create this transition from the CharacterWalk state instead.  However I am using Any State because as we add more animations for the character, we won't need to define as many total transitions.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>How do animation conditions work?</summary>

For transitions with one or more conditions, we change states when all conditions are met.  This could be a single parameter such as the bool we are using here, or it could be a combination of factors.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What does the Transition Duration impact?</summary>

Once the conditions are met, the transition from one state to the other completes in the 'Transition Duration' time.  This is a great feature for 3D models as the Unity animator will smooth the transition from one stance to another.  However for sprites, there is no smoothing so we typically want a transition duration of 0.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What does the Can Transition to Self impact?</summary>

When creating a transition from Any State, an option for Can Transition to Self is available.  

 - Checked (the default): This transition applies even when in the target state.  In this example, since the condition is just a bool check and there is no Exit Time - transition to self would cause the animation to keep starting over.
 - Unchecked: This transition effectively does not exist while in the target state.  e.g. I can't jump restart jumping while jumping.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What does Exit Time do and how does it relate to conditions?</summary>

Has Exit Time is an additional way of triggering a transition.  So if a transition has both Has Exit Time and Conditions defined, the transition occurs when **either** the time has passed **or** the conditions are true.

## 5.8) Additional character animations

Add an animation for when climbing ladders and while idle.

<details><summary>How</summary>

Climb animation:

 - Create a new animation for the character Animations/**CharacterClimb**.anim
   - Drag in the sprites for the climb animation.  We are using **adverturer_spritesheet_5** and **6**.
 - Open the character's Animator Controller:
   - Select the CharacterClimb state and use the Speed parameter times .1
   - Create a transition from Any State to CharacterClimb.
     - Condition: isClimbing true
   - Create a transition from CharacterClimb to CharacterWalk.
     - Uncheck Has Exit Time
     - Transition Duration: 0
     - Uncheck Can Transition to Self
     - Condition: isClimbing false
   - Select the transition from Any State to CharacterJump
     - Condition: isClimbing false

<br>Idle animation:

 - Create a new animation for the character Animations/**CharacterIdle**.anim
   - Click record
     - Change the 'Sprite' under the character's Sprite Renderer component to an idle stance. We are using **adventurer_tilesheet_0**.
     - Double click to create a keyframe at 1:00.
     - Switch the current time position to 0:30.
       - This will move the white line, indicating where in the timeline modifications will be made. 
     - Set the Transform scale to (1, .95, 1).
     - Switch the time to 1:00 and set the Transform scale to (1, 1, 1).
     - Then stop recording.   
 - Open the character's Animator Controller:
   - In the Animator, create a transition from CharacterWalk to CharacterIdle:
     - Uncheck Has Exit Time
     - Transition Duration: 0
     - Condition: 'Speed' is 'Less' than '.1'
   - Make a transition from CharacterIdle to CharacterWalk:
     - Uncheck Has Exit Time
     - Transition Duration: 0
     - Condition: 'Speed' is 'Greater' than '.1'

<br>Breakdance animation:

 - Create a new animation for the character Animations/**CharacterDance**.anim
   - Select all the sprites for this animation and drag them into the timeline. We are using **adventurer_tilesheet_11** **- 21** (10 sprites).
 - Open the character's Animator Controller:
   - Change the CharacterDance speed to '.1'
   - Create a transition from CharacterIdle to CharacterDance.
     - Exit Time: 3
     - Transition Duration: 0
   - Create a transition from CharacterDance to CharacterIdle.
     - Transition Duration: 0
   - Create a transition from CharacterDance to CharacterWalk.
     - Uncheck 'Has Exit Time'
     - Transition Duration: 0
     - Condition: 'Speed' is 'Greater' than '.1'

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Climb animation:

A climb animation for the character was added. As you climb up or down a ladder, the character should move his arms and then resume walking when he gets off.

The animation created works just like the original walk animation we created for the character.  By default the speed is way too fast so we turn this down in the Animator Controller.

<br>Idle animation:

When the character is not moving, he will switch to the idle stance.  We also modify the scale, from 1 to .95 on the Y and then back to 1 to create the breathing effect.  

Hit play so see the character switch between walking and standing:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YjZ1zrE.gif" width=300px />

<br>Breakdance animation:

The character will dance after standing still for a few seconds.

We use Exit Time to define how long the character should be in the CharacterIdle state before dancing.  If you start to walk during the dance, he will switch to the walk animation right away.
