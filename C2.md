Add a sprite to the scene representing the middle segment of a platform.  

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Add a platform**:

 - Click and drag the platform sprite you want to use into the Scene window. 
   - We are using **stoneHalf_mid**.

<br>**Tile the width**:

 - In the Hierarchy window, select the 'stoneHalf_mid' GameObject.
 - In the Inspector, under the SpriteRenderer component:
   - Draw Mode: Tiled
   - New Size options appear: 
      - Width: 23.04

<details><summary>What's a GameObject, Transform, and Component?</summary>

Everything you see and interact with in a game is driven by GameObjects.  Typically a GameObject represents a single logical object in the world (e.g. a character).  It may be composed of child GameObjects, each responsible for part of the display and/or behaviour. It may also hold various components.  

A component is a set of logic (i.e. code) which may be added to a GameObject, or child GameObject, and is exposed in the 'Inspector' window for the GameObject you have selected in the 'Hierarchy'.  A GameObject may have any number of components and those components may by configured to customize the behaviour for that specific object.  

Unity has a number of components available out of the box, we will be using several Unity components in this tutorial and will be making many custom components as well.

A Transform component manages the GameObject's position, rotation and scale.  Every GameObject, including child GameObjects, have a Transform. Occasionally you will encounter a GameObject that has nothing rendered on screen.  In these cases the Transform is often completely ignored but may not be removed.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's a SpriteRenderer?</summary>

SpriteRenderer is a Unity component which renders a sprite on screen.  When we drag and dropped the sprite, a GameObject was created with a SpriteRenderer component automatically added.

Select the GameObject in the 'Hierarchy' to view the SpriteRenderer component for this object in the 'Inspector'.  Here several options are available for modifying how the sprite is rendered.  For example:

 - Sprite: This is the sprite image to render.  It was populated automatically when you created the GameObject with drag/drop.
 - Color: White is the default, displaying the sprite as it was created by the artist.  Changing this color modifies the sprite's appearance.  You can also use the alpha value here to make a sprite transparent.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's tiling do and why not use Transform scale?</summary>

Tiling causes a sprite to repeat as it gets larger, instead of stretching like would happen when using transform scale.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ejbs3RK.png" width=300px />

We wanted to start with a platform that covers most of the screen.  When we attach edges to these platforms we want patterns to line up.  If the width does not tile evenly, you may have only part of the pattern on the edges making it harder to align with other platforms.

To avoid this issue we scale by an even multiple of the original size.  For this sprite the original is 1.28 and we are using 8 times that (i.e. 23.04)

<hr></details>

## 2.2) Platform edges

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/4b68dff87f90f788db668273d16e6539374689b0.zip) | [Source after]()

Create a new parent GameObject for the platform sprite and add edge sprites.

<details open><summary>How</summary>

**Create a parent Platform**:

 - In the Hierarchy, right click and 'Create Empty'.
   - Rename to "Platform".
   - Ensure the Transform is at defaults (position 0, rotation 0, scale 1) for both the 'Platform' and the sprite's GameObject 'spritesheet_ground_72'.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/FAkZf1H.png" width=300px />

TODO this is easy to miss, need debugging tips 

 - Drag and drop the sprite (spritesheet_ground_72) onto the Platform GameObject.  
 
It should appear indented under Platform in the Hierarchy:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/XOve0Ap.png" width=300px />

<br>Add rounded corners to platforms:


 - Click and drag one of the edge sprites onto the 'Platform' GameObject. We're using **spritesheet_ground_65** and **spritesheet_ground_79**.
   - The edge sprite should be a child GameObject, like the middle sprite.  If it does not appear indented, drag drop in the Hierarchy window to rearrange.
   - Confirm that each of the child sprites are still at 0 position, 0 rotation, and 1 scale.  The edge sprites may have an X position when we are done.
 - Move the edge sprite away from the main platform:   
   - Select the edge sprite (one of the child GameObjects).
   - Use the move tool to position it away from the other sprites.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/bYsJhjs.png" width=150px />

 - Use Vertex Snap to position the edge next to the main platform:
   - Hold V to enable Vertex Snap mode.
   - A box appears for each anchor point (e.g. the corners of the sprite).  Hover over the top right corner.
   - Click and drag the box.  The sprite will snap perfectly with other anchor points in the world.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/L82mkXu.gif" width=300px />

 - Repeat for both edges, creating smooth corners on both sides of the platform.


TODO 
9:49  Moderator  Verified  HardlyDifficult: yea ... even as in an even multiple of the original 1.28. that's clear right =p just confirmed that works with those sprites. so try 12.8 width

TODO size and positioning will keep changing, don't try to get it perfect.

<details><summary>Why create a parent GameObject?</summary>

Most of the platforms we will be creating require multiple different sprites to display correctly.  We tackle this in the next section.  Even for platforms which are represented with a single sprite, it's nice to be consistent across all of our platforms.

The implications of using a parent GameObject or not will be more clear when we start to add game mechanics later in the tutorial.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>How is the sprite position calculated when it's a child?</summary>

When a GameObject is a child of another GameObject, it's position, rotation, and scale are the combination of the child's Transform and the parent's Transform (via matrix multiplication).  

Typically all Transform updates during the game and in level design are done to the parent GameObject.  Child Transforms are often static offsets from the center of the parent GameObject.  e.g. we'll be adding rounded edges to the platform, which will require an x offset so they are positioned next to the middle segment.

<hr></details>

## 1.16) Create two connected platforms

[YouTube]() | [Source before]() | [Source after]()

Our level design calls for the bottom platform to rotate half way through.  Create two Platform GameObjects and position and rotate their parents' GameObjects so that they appear connected.

<details><summary>How</summary>

TODO too verbose.

 - Use two copies of the Platform GameObject.
   - Select and copy / paste or right click and 'Duplicate'.
 - Move their parent GameObjects so that the sprites appear near the bottom of the screen, side by side. 
 - Raise the right Platform a little above the left.
 - Delete the rounded edges from both Platforms.
 - Increase the 'Width' of middle sprite of each platform to about 15 so that the platforms combined cover more than the width of the screen.
 - Use Vertex Snap (by holding V) to reposition the edges.
 - Select the parent GameObject for the Platform on the right and use the rotate tool to modify the Transform's rotation Z value to about 4.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/3s1bSBb.png" width=150px>

The scene should look something like this:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/kL3NvA7.png" width=500px>

 - Select the middle sprite's GameObject for the platform on the right.
 - Drag and drop that child GameObject out of the Platform so it stands alone. (it will still appear at the same position/rotation). 
 - With Vertex Snap, use the box in the bottom left corner to drag the platform and connect perfectly with the other.
 - Copy paste the Transform position from the child you just placed to its original parent GameObject.
 - Drag and drop the sprite back into the original parent GameObject.
   - Confirm the child GameObject's Transform position and rotation are at 0.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/iJ4fdYQ.gif" width=700px />

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>Why not use a single GameObject for this bottom platform?</summary>

Up next we will be adding colliders to these platforms.  There are several ways this could be handled, as is always the case with GameDev. We will be placing BoxCollider2Ds on our Platforms' parent GameObjects.  This works great when the parent is a middle sprite segment along with a rounded corner sprite - but does not work as well when the platform changes it's rotation half way through.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why extend the platform beyond the edge of the screen?</summary>

The width of the world players are going to see is fixed so you could argue that extending over the edge is not necessary.  I recommend this to ensure there are no unexpected gaps at the edge and to leave some flexibility for future mechanics, including:

 - Allow some enemies to continue off screen and use the platform we can't see before returning to the game.
 - Screen shake.  This works by moving the camera up/down/left/right a bit.  Having the platforms extend beyond the edge of the screen allows us to do that without exposing gaps.

<hr></details>


## 1.17) Complete level 1 platform layout

[YouTube]() | [Source before]() | [Source after]()

At this point we have covered everything you need to match the level 1 platform layout.  You can match the layout we used or come up with your own.

<details><summary>How</summary>


The basic steps are:

 - Copy a parent Platform to start from.
 - Modify the tile 'Width' for the middle segment as needed.  Platforms should extend off the screen a bit.
 - Use Vertex Snap to position the edge sprites.
 - Move and rotate the sprite by modifying the parent GameObject, leaving the children at position and rotation 0, with the exception of the corner sprites which have an X position.
 - You can delete the rounded edges which are completely off screen.

Optionally, you can rename the platform GameObjects and organize your platforms by placing them in a parent GameObject.  e.g.:

 - Click and drag to re-arrange the platform GameObjects so they appear in the same order in the hierarchy as they do in game.
 - Rename each to represent it's position - e.g. "Level2".
 - Create an Empty GameObject, name it "Platforms".  Ensure that it is a position 0.
 - Select all of your existing platforms (the parent GameObjects) and click and drag them onto "Platforms".

The project should looks something like this, but don't worry about trying to match it perfectly:

## 1.18) Add colliders and effectors (TODO move effectors to jump)

[YouTube]() | [Source before]() | [Source after]()

Add a BoxCollider2D and PlatformEffector2D to each of the Platforms.  Add an edge radius and edit colliders to match the sprites.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Select a platform's parent GameObject.
 - Click the 'Add Component' button, type **BoxCollider2D** and select it from the list.
   - Under Box Collider 2D in the Inspector, set 'Edge Radius' to '.1'

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/yM4DRr6.png" width=300px>

 - Click 'Edit Collider' and click/drag the box which appears so that the outer green line encapsulates the platform.
    - Click and then hold Alt while adjusting the sides to pull both sides in evenly.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Q4T1KfJ.gif" width=300px />

 - Repeat for each of the platforms.
   - For the bottom platforms which are two connected parent platform GameObjects - allow the colliders to overlap a little.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/D5gBSiW.gif" width=300px />

<br>Add a PlatformerEffector2D to each platform:

 - Select all of the Platform GameObjects.
   - Add **PlatformEffector2D**.
     - Change the 'Surface Arc' to '35'.
   - Under the BoxCollider2D, select 'Use by Effector'.

</details><br>

<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Colliders define an objects shape for the purposes of physical collisions.  We use the edge radius on the box collider in order to smooth out the corners and better match the platform art.

For the bottom platforms, we overlap the colliders for a smooth experience when entities are walking from one to the next.

<br>Add a PlatformerEffector2D to each platform:


The PlatformerEffector2D creates one-way collisions for our platforms.  This allows entities to jump through a platform and land on top -- a common mechanic for platformer games.

Reduce the PlatformerEffector2D Surface Arc disables collisions on the sides of the platforms, preventing the character from sticking to the side in a strange way.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What is a Collider?</summary>

Colliders are components placed on GameObjects to define their shape for the purposes of physical collisions.  The collider shape may or may not align with the visuals on screen.

Typically colliders match the shape of the art on screen.  For example, they are used to keep the character from falling through the floor or walking through walls, and to cause the character to die when they hit an enemy.

Colliders may also be used as 'triggers' to detect something happening near an object without causing a physical reaction.  For example, an entity could have a second collider twice as large as the entity itself and use that to know when danger is approaching - causing the entity to run the other way.

More on [colliders from Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CollidersOverview.html).

</details>
<details><summary>Why not place colliders on the child GameObjects instead?</summary>

Well, you could!  With GameDev, you'll find there are almost always various ways you could achieve a goal and pros/cons to each.  

Since we are using BoxCollider2D and an Edge radius, getting our sprites to connect with a smooth surface for entities to walk over would be more challenging when the colliders are on the child sprite GameObjects instead of the parent Platform.  

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QTjSEt7.png" width=50% />

Additionally, fewer colliders may improve your game's performance - however the difference here will not be noticeable.

</details>
<details><summary>What are Effectors?</summary>

Effectors in Unity are easy ways to add various mechanics to the game.  The one-way collision effect we are using here happens to be a very common mechanic for 2D games, so Unity has this component ready to drop in.  

Unity is not doing anything with these components that you technically could not have built yourself in a custom script, but that said adding the one-way effect the PlatformerEffector2D creates would not be easy to do.

Read more about the [various 2d effectors in Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Effectors2D.html) including a conveyor belt, repulsion, and floating effects.

</details>
<details><summary>What does Surface Arc do and why not use a value of 1?</summary>

The surface arc for an effector changes the supported region, in this case the surfaces which are collidable.  By reducing this we are causing the sides to be treated as non-collidable like the bottoms are by default. 

The surface arc is defined in degrees around the Transform's up direction, and compared against the normal of the surface of the collider at the point of collision to determine if effects apply (in this case, if collisions apply).

A very small surface arc still allows the primary use case to work correctly, i.e. you can still stand on platforms.  The sides, where a rounded edge appears, may not be collidable causing the character to fall off prematurely.  

You can adjust the surface arc to find a value that feels good.
