## 4.2) Detect floors

Create a script to calculate the distance to and rotation of the floor under an entity.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Create a layer 'Floor'.
 - Select all the Platform GameObjects and change to Layer Floor.
   - When prompted, select 'No, this object only'.
 - Create script Components/Movement/**FloorDetector**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(Collider2D))]
public class FloorDetector : MonoBehaviour
{
  static readonly Quaternion backwardsRotation
    = Quaternion.Euler(0, 0, 180);

  Collider2D myCollider;

  [SerializeField]
  ContactFilter2D floorFilter;

  Collider2D[] possibleCollisionResultList = new Collider2D[3];
  
  public Bounds feetBounds
  {
    get
    {
      return myCollider.bounds;
    }
  }

  public bool isTouchingFloor

    get; private set;
  }

  public float? distanceToFloor

    get; private set;
  }

  public Vector2? floorUp
  {
    get; private set;
  }

  public Quaternion? floorRotation
  {
    get; private set;
  }

  protected void Awake()
  {
    myCollider = GetComponent<Collider2D>();
  }

  protected void FixedUpdate()
  {
    Collider2D floorWeAreStandingOn = DetectTheFloorWeAreStandingOn();
    isTouchingFloor = floorWeAreStandingOn != null;

    if(floorWeAreStandingOn != null)
    {
      CalculateFloorRotation(floorWeAreStandingOn);
      distanceToFloor = 0;
    }
    else
    {
      floorUp = null;
      floorRotation = null;
      Collider2D floorUnderUs = DetectFloorUnderUs();
      if(floorUnderUs != null)
      {
        distanceToFloor = CalculateDistanceToFloor(floorUnderUs);
      }
      else
      {
        distanceToFloor = null;
      }
    }
  }

  float CalculateDistanceToFloor(
    Collider2D floorUnderUs)
  {
    float yOfTopOfFloor = floorUnderUs.bounds.max.y;

    if(floorUnderUs is BoxCollider2D)
    {
      BoxCollider2D boxCollider = (BoxCollider2D)floorUnderUs;
      yOfTopOfFloor += boxCollider.edgeRadius;

    floorRotation = floorWeAreStandingOn.transform.rotation;
    if(Vector2.Dot(Vector2.up, floorUp.Value) < 0)
    {
      floorUp = -floorUp;
      floorRotation *= backwardsRotation;
    }
  }

  Collider2D DetectFloorUnderUs()
  {
    RaycastHit2D[] result = new RaycastHit2D[1];
    if(Physics2D.Raycast(
      transform.position, 
      Vector2.down,
      floorFilter, 
      result) > 0)
    {
      return result[0].collider;
    }

    return null;
  }

  Collider2D DetectTheFloorWeAreStandingOn()
  {
    int foundColliderCount
      = Physics2D.OverlapCollider(myCollider, floorFilter, possibleCollisionResultList);

    for(int i = 0; i < foundColliderCount; i++)

      Collider2D collider = possibleCollisionResultList[i];
      ColliderDistance2D distance = collider.Distance(myCollider);

      if(distance.distance >= -.1f
        && Vector2.Dot(Vector2.up, distance.normal) > 0)
      {
        return collider;
      }
    }

    return null;
  }
}
```

 - Add **FloorDetector** to:
   - The Character prefab.
   - The SpikeBall prefab.
   - The HoverGuy's Feet child GameObject.
 - For each of those FloorDetector components, update the Floor Filter:
     - Check Use Layer Mask
     - Layer Mask: Floor

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

The FloorDetector collects information about the floor under the entity for other components to leverage:

 - feetYPosition: The y position of the bottom of the entity's feet.
 - isTouchingFloor: True if the entity is currently on the ground vs jumping or falling.
 - floorUp: the normal of the floor the entity is standing on, or the direction perpendicular to the floor.
 - floorRotation: the rotation of the floor the entity is standing on.
 - distanceToFloor: how far above the floor the entity's feet currently are.  0 if isTouchingFloor.

Each FixedUpdate, we use OverlapCollider to find the floor we may be standing on.  We check multiple results and filter out instances which are overlapping the bottom of a platform (necessary because of the one-way platforms), if any remain - the closest is the floor we are on.

If we are standing on a floor we then get rotation information.  If the floor is upside down, we flip these stats as well.

If we are not standing on a floor, we Raycast below the entity to get the distanceToFloor.

<details><summary>What's a C# Nullable type / what's the question mark after 'float'?</summary>

Structs in C# must have a value (as opposed to classes which may have a value or be null).  Sometimes this is limiting and another piece of information is required.  

Nullable types in C# are a feature which allows you to add one more possible value to any struct, by adding a question mark after the type. For example:

```csharp
bool? trueFalseOrNull;
trueFalseOrNull = null;
trueFalseOrNull = true;
trueFalseOrNull = false;
```

Often nullable types are used to indicate an error state or that no valid information is available.  Without the nullable feature, you may have implemented the same using another variable to indicate the state - or by using a magic number.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's C# 'is' do and how's it differ from 'as'?</summary>

In C#, 'is' may be used to check if an object is compatible with a given type - i.e. if a cast to that type would be successful.  For example:

```csharp
Collider2D floorUnderUs;
...
if(floorUnderUs is BoxCollider2D) 
{
  BoxCollider2D boxCollider = (BoxCollider2D)floorUnderUs;
  ...
}
```

'as' is a similar feature where instead of returning true or false, it returns null or the casted value.  For example:

```csharp
Collider2D floorUnderUs;
...
BoxCollider2D boxCollider = floorUnderUs as BoxCollider2D;
if(boxCollider != null) 
{
  ...
}
```

<details><summary>What's Dot product do?</summary>

The Dot product is a fast operation which can be used to efficiently determine if two directions represented with Vectors are facing the same (or a similar) way.

In the visualization below, we are rotating two ugly arrows.  These arrows are pointing in a direction and we are using Vector2.Dot to compare those two directions.  The Dot product is shown as we rotate around.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/XrjcWQm.gif" width=200px />

A few notables about Dot products:

 - '1' means the two directions are facing the same way.
 - '-1' means the two directions are facing opposite ways.
 - '0' means the two directions are perpendicular.
 - Numbers smoothly transition between these points, so .9 means that the two directions are nearly identical.
 - When two directions are not the same, the Dot product will not tell you which direction an object should rotate in order to make them align - it only informs you about how similar they are at the moment.  

For this visualization, we are calculating the Dot product like so:

```csharp
Vector2.Dot(gameObjectAToWatch.transform.up, gameObjectBToWatch.transform.up);
```

<details><summary>When do you use OverlapCollider vs Raycast vs Distance vs Trigger*?</summary>

Unity offers a number of APIs for getting information about objects around you.  They are optimized for different use cases, and often you could have accomplished the same mechanic using a different API.

Until now in this tutorial we have been using Trigger* events (e.g. OnTriggerEnter2D).  These events push information to your script to react to.  Sometimes, like here, it's easier to pull the information.

We are using 3 different APIs to pull information in this script:

 - OverlapCollider returns the colliders which are touching this entity's collider.
 - Raycast projects a line and returns colliders intersecting with it (in order, closest first).  There are other 'cast' calls to project different shapes when needed, e.g. BoxCast.
 - collider.Distance returns precise information about the collision between two specific colliders, such as the contact point or if they are not touching the distance between them.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why add the edge radius to bounds max when calculating the floor's position?</summary>

When edge radius is used on a BoxCollider, the collider bounds represents the inner square of the collider (the size before edge is consider).  So in order to get the correct position we must add the edge radius in as well.

## 4.3) Prevent double jump

Update JumpMovement to prevent double jump and flying (by spamming space), by leveraging the FloorDetector just created.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Update Components/Movement/**JumpMovement**:

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(Rigidbody2D))]
[RequireComponent(typeof(AudioSource))]
```

</details>

```csharp
[RequireComponent(typeof(FloorDetector))] 
```

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
public class JumpMovement : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  AudioClip jumpSound;

  [SerializeField]
  float jumpSpeed = 7f;

  Rigidbody2D myBody;
```

</details>

```csharp
  FloorDetector floorDetector; 
```

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
  AudioSource audioSource;

  bool wasJumpRequestedSinceLastFixedUpdate;

  protected void Awake()
  {
    myBody = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
```

</details>

```csharp
    floorDetector = GetComponent<FloorDetector>(); 
```

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
    audioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();
  }

  public void Jump()
  {
    wasJumpRequestedSinceLastFixedUpdate = true;
  }

  protected void FixedUpdate()
  {
    if(wasJumpRequestedSinceLastFixedUpdate
```

</details>

```csharp
      && floorDetector.isTouchingFloor
```

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
      ) 
    {
      myBody.AddForce(
          new Vector2(0, jumpSpeed),
          ForceMode2D.Impulse);

      audioSource.PlayOneShot(jumpSound);
    }

    wasJumpRequestedSinceLastFixedUpdate = false;
  }
}
```

</details>


<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

We are leveraging the FloorDetector component in order to prevent jumps when the character is not touching the floor.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why not use a cooldown instead?</summary>

You may consider using a cooldown by time instead.  This would create a different play experience, and if the cooldown is short the player may be able to double jump (but not fly by spamming space).

You might also want both a cooldown and the floor detection.  Small changes to mechanics like this can change how the game feels while playing.

## 4.4) Update wander to prefer traveling up hill

Update the WanderWalkController so that the HoverGuy is more likely to walk up hill than down.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Update Components/Movement/**WanderWalkController**:

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(WalkMovement))]
public class WanderWalkController : MonoBehaviour
{
```

</details>

```csharp
  [SerializeField]
  float oddsOfGoingUpHill = .8f; 
```

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
  [SerializeField]
  float timeBeforeFirstWander = 10;

  [SerializeField]
  float minTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection = 1;

  [SerializeField]
  float maxTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection = 10;

  WalkMovement walkMovement;
```

</details>

```csharp
  FloorDetector floorDetector; 
```

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
  protected void Awake()
  {
    walkMovement = GetComponent<WalkMovement>();
```

</details>

```csharp
    floorDetector = GetComponentInChildren<FloorDetector>(); 
```

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
  }

  protected void Start()
  {
    StartCoroutine(Wander());
  }

  IEnumerator Wander()
  {
    walkMovement.desiredWalkDirection = 1;
    if(timeBeforeFirstWander > 0) 
    {
      yield return new WaitForSeconds(timeBeforeFirstWander);
    }

    while(true)
    {
      SelectARandomWalkDirection();

      float timeToSleep = UnityEngine.Random.Range(
        minTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection,
        maxTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection);
      yield return new WaitForSeconds(timeToSleep);
    }
  }

  void SelectARandomWalkDirection()
  {
```

</details>

```csharp
    float dot;
    if(floorDetector.floorUp != null)
    {
      dot = Vector2.Dot(floorDetector.floorUp.Value, Vector2.right);
    }
    else
    {
      dot = 0;
    }

    if(dot < 0)
    { 
      walkMovement.desiredWalkDirection
        = UnityEngine.Random.value <= oddsOfGoingUpHill ? 1 : -1;
    }
    else if(dot > 0)
    { 
      walkMovement.desiredWalkDirection
        = UnityEngine.Random.value <= oddsOfGoingUpHill ? -1 : 1;
    }
    else
    { 
```

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
      walkMovement.desiredWalkDirection
        = UnityEngine.Random.value <= .5f ? 1 : -1; 
```

</details>

```csharp
    }
```

<details><summary>Existing code</summary>

```csharp
  }
}
```

</details>
<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Leveraging the FloorDetector, we give the HoverGuy better odds at walking up a platform vs walking down one.  Without this component the HoverGuy enemies may collect at the bottom of the level - this keeps them mostly moving forward/up while still using RNG to keep the player on their toes.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why take the Dot product with Vector2.right?</summary>

Dot product is used to determine if two directions are pointing the same way.  We compare the floor's up direction (or its normal) to the world right.  If the dot product is positive then we know that the platform is traveling down and to the right; if negative the platform is down and to the left; and it would be 0 if the platform were flat.

## 4.5) Rotate so feet are flat on the floor

Create a script to rotate an entity, aligning with the floor when touching one, otherwise rotating back to the default position.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Create script Components/Movement/**RotateToAlignWithFloor**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class RotateToAlignWithFloor : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  float lerpSpeedToFloor = .4f;

  [SerializeField]
  float lerpSpeedWhileInAir = .05f;

  FloorDetector floorDetector;

  protected void Awake()
  {
    floorDetector
      = GetComponentInChildren<FloorDetector>();
  }

  protected void Update()
  {
    Quaternion rotation;
    float speed;
    if(floorDetector.floorRotation != null)
    {
      rotation = floorDetector.floorRotation.Value;
      speed = lerpSpeedToFloor;
    }
    else
    {
      rotation = Quaternion.identity;
      speed = lerpSpeedWhileInAir;
    }

    transform.rotation = Quaternion.Lerp(
      transform.rotation,
      rotation,
      speed * Time.deltaTime);
  }
}
```

 - Add **RotateToAlignWithFloor** to the Character and HoverGuy prefabs.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

When the entity is standing on a floor, we gradually rotate it so its feet are flat on the floor.  When jumping or falling, we slowly rotate back to facing straight up.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's 'Lerp' and how's it compare to 'Slerp'?</summary>

Lerp, or **l**inear int**erp**olation, is a fancy term for a simple concept.  Draw a line between two points and travel a certain percent along that path, returning the position you end on.  For example:

```csharp
void Start()
{
  Vector2 a = new Vector2(1, 5);
  Vector2 b = new Vector2(4, 11);
  Vector2 c = Vector2.Lerp(a, b, 1/3f);
  print(c); // == (2, 7)
}
```

Slerp, or **s**pherical **l**inear int**erp**olation, is similar to lerp but the change in position accelerates at the beginning and decelerates towards the end.  It's called spherical because it is following the path of a half circle instead of a straight line.

Here you can see lerp vs slerp with only position X changing (the large balls), and change X and Y.  All are moving given the same % progress.  Notice how the movement for slerp at beginning and end are traveling at a different speed than the lerp - but the positions match exactly at the start, middle, and end.
