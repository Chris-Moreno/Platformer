## 1.1) Start a 2D project and import assets

Get Unity and start a 2D project. 

Zip of [all the art assets we are using](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2bFgoFxZ-alc0NUejM5cFF5N28).  (TODO this will need updating)

<details><summary>How</summary>

Start a new project:

 - [Download Visual Studio Community edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/), if you don't already have it.
 - [Download Unity 2017](https://unity3d.com/), the free Personal edition has everything you need. 
   - You may be prompted to register / sign in.
 - Select '2D' when creating a new project.
 - Enter a name/directory - the other options can be left at defaults.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/q5NVa7p.png" width=300 />

<br>Import assets:

 - Right click in the 'Project' window's Assets directory -> Create Folder named "Art".
   - You can rename folders by selecting and pressing F2.
 - Drag/drop all the assets (images and sounds) into the folder you just created.
   - If you have a zip file, you may need to unzip to a temp directory before drag/drop will work.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/7JleUl7.png" width=300px />

 - Create additional directories which we will be using to organize our game:
   - Assets/**Art**
   - Assets/**Code**
     - Assets/Code/**Components**
     - Assets/Code/**Editor**
     - Assets/Code/**Utils**
   - Assets/**Prefabs**
   - Assets/**Scenes**

TODO create directory structure

TODO check if the sprites present a compression warning.

<br>Save the current scene:

 - File -> 'Save Scenes'.
 - Save it as Assets/Scenes/**Level1**.

<details><summary>Can I Unity 5.* or Monodevelop instead?</summary>

Most of the tutorial will work with Unity 5.*, but we will be using the Timeline Editor which was not fully released until 2017.  Because of this you may get stuck on Chapter 5, animations.

You can use Monodevelop or Visual Studio, or any other IDE.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Whats the difference between 2D and 3D?</summary>

Presenting the 2D vs 3D option when you create a new project suggests this is a significant choice.  It's not really... 2D just changes default settings on things like your camera.   Unity is a 3D engine, when creating 2D games your actually creating a 3D world where everything is very flat but the camera looks straight ahead and the only rotation in the world is around the z axis.  

[More on 2D vs 3D from Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/2Dor3D.html).

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's a scene?</summary>

The Scene represents a collection of GameObjects and components (defined below) configured for a game level or menu screen.  For this tutorial we are starting by creating part of Level 1.  Level 2, the menu, and other UI screens will be saved as separate scenes.  You can switch scenes via the SceneManager, and will cover this later in the tutorial. 

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Can I name folders differently?</summary>

Absolutely, with one exception.  "Editor" is a special folder name with Unity, anything under that directory is only run when testing in the Unity editor.

More about [special folder names from Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpecialFolders.html).

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's a sprite / sprite sheet?</summary>

A sprite is an image, used in 2D games and for UI.  They may represent an object, part of an object, or a frame of an entity's animation, etc.  

A sprite sheet is a single image file that contains multiple individual sprites.  The sheet may use these sprites to represent different frames for an animation or to hold a collection of various object types (as is the case here).

We will be using sprites only, and not sprite sheets, in this tutorial.  Unity occasionally has render issues which display while using sprite sheets.  

Sprite sheets are an optimization technique games use. Unity has a sprite packer feature that can be used to automatically create sprite sheets.  Once you are in the optimization phase of your project, you could look into the sprite packer to try and gain anything that might have been lost from using individual sprites instead.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Who made the art for this tutorial?</summary>

We are using:
 - [Kenney.nl's Platformer Pack Redux](http://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-pack-redux) **spritesheets/spritesheet_ground.png**.

And TODO

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Can I use my own art?</summary>

Of course, this tutorial only assumes that you are using sprites.  You can build your own sprite sheet or use individual sprites, but this tutorial is geared towards a 2D game and some things may not work out well if you try using 3D models instead.

For sounds, we don't have many - just enough to introduce how they may be added to a game.  Unity supports many formats including wav and mp3 you could use.

## 1.4) Configure sprites

Update each sprite's and sprite sheet's import settings to use filter mode point.

<details><summary>How</summary>

Mesh type:

 - Select all the sprites.
 - In the Inspector, set 'Mesh Type: Full Rect'.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Dhe3Nzt.png" width=300px />

<br>Filter mode:

 - Select all of the sprites and sprite sheets.
   - Use Ctrl click or shift click as you would while selecting in Windows Explorer.
 - In the 'Inspector', set 'Filter Mode' to 'Point (no filter)' and apply changes.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/B0nqf75.png" width=300px />


<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What is mesh type?</summary>

When a sprite is rendered to the screen, a combination of a mesh (like used for 3D objects) outlining the sprite and transparency is used to draw the picture on screen.  Tradeoffs here are beyond the scope of this tutorial.

 - Tight will attempt to better outline the sprite, using more polygons in the mesh.
 - Full Rect will use 2 triangles per sprite.

When using tiling on a sprite, Unity recommends updating the sprite sheet to use 'Full Rect'.  I don't have an example of issues that may arise from using 'Tight' instead, but here is the warning from Unity recommending 'Full Rect':

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/e9jE83B.png" width=50% />

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What is filter mode?</summary>

Using point filter mode gets us closer to pixel perfect sprites and prevents some visual glitches.

Filter mode of Bilinear or Trilinear blurs the image a bit in attempt to make smooth lines.  Often for a 2D game, we want control down to the pixel and this effect is not desirable.  Here's an example with the character sprite we will be using:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/AYyx3Ma.png" width=150px />

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/8wMlM1S.png"  width=150px />

For sprite sheets, often each object is touching the one next to it.  Filter Mode Point prevents blending happening between one sprite and it's neighbor.  The blending that occurs with other modes besides Point may lead to random lines showing up on screen.  For example:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZKqg5JP.png" width=50% />

<hr></details>


## 1.6) Disable Anti-Aliasing

Update the project settings, disabling Anti-Aliasing for each quality level.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Menu 'Edit' -> 'Project Settings' -> 'Quality'.
 - In the Inspector change 'Anti Aliasing' to 'Disabled'.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/auHPjbi.png" width=300px />

 - Repeat this for each quality 'Level'.
   - Click on the row to modify (e.g. 'Very High').
   - Update Anti Aliasing if needed.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/KYym6V0.png" width=300px />

 - Click 'Ultra' to resume testing with the best settings.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What is Anti-Aliasing and why disable it?</summary>

Anti Aliasing is a technique used to smooth jagged edges as shown here:

<img src="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-10856ecbea4f439fb9fb751d41ff704a" width=50% />

Disabling Anti Aliasing gets us closer to pixel perfect sprites and prevents some visual glitches. Like changing the filter mode to Point, we do this when working with sprites because we often want control over images down to the pixel.

Anti-aliasing may lead to unexpected gaps or distortions when sprites are side by side.  Here is an example that appears when using tiling and Anti Aliasing is enabled:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/vY5YmVj.png" width=50% />

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why do we need to change this setting multiple times?</summary>

The highlighted Level is what you are testing with ATM.  It will default to Ultra.  The green checkboxes represent the default quality level for different build types.  In this example I'm testing with Ultra, using Ultra by default for PC builds, and High by default for WebGL builds.  To avoid artifacts, I disable Anti Aliasing in every level and then switch back to Ultra.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why not update the camera instead?</summary>

In the camera in your scene has an option to not 'Allow MSAA'.  Disabling this will turn off Anti-Aliasing as we had done above.  Since Anti-Aliasing is disabled in the project settings this checkbox has not effect.

You could opt to disable Anti-Aliasing in the camera and not in the project settings - however if you do be sure that cameras you use in other scenes have the same settings.

<hr></details>

## 1.7) Select an aspect ratio

Change the aspect ratio to 5:4 in the Game window and build settings.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - In the 'Game' window, near the top, change 'Free Aspect' to '5:4'.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/MTnZtu4.png" width=300px />

You'll also want to update the supported resolutions for the different platforms you may cut a build for:

 - Menu File -> 'Build Settings'.
 - Select the desired platform and click 'Player Settings'.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/R1B43yZ.png" width=300px />

 - In the Inspector, set the supported resolution or aspect ratio (this will be different for different platform types), for example:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/to0M9sA.png" width=300px />

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/NhCWDTp.png" width=300px />

TODO label pictures PC and GL.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>Why use a fixed aspect ratio</summary>

We are building a game with a fixed display.  The camera is not going to follow the character which will simplify the game and level design for this tutorial.  With a fixed aspect ratio we can design a scene without any camera movement and be sure everyone has the same experience.

The white box here represents the area that players will see:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/eIq2LD2.png" width=300px />

Different resolutions will scale the display larger or smaller but everyone will see the same amount of the world.

5:4 was an arbitrary choice, use anything you'd like.

<hr></details>


## 1.8) Configure camera

Update the camera size to about 10 and change the background color to black.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - In the 'Hierarchy' window, select the 'Main Camera'.
 - In the Inspector, change 'Size' to '10'.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/PmeoqG7.png" width=300px />

 - Change 'Background' color and select black.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QKGcl9o.png" width=300px />

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

We zoomed out a bit so that more of the world is visible on screen.

In the Scene, the white box representing the viewable area has grown.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why change 'Size' and not camera position?</summary>

2D games by default use 'Projection: Orthographic'.  This means that the camera does not consider perspective, the ability to see more of the world the further it is from your eye. The amount of the world visible with a perspective camera is driven by it's position.  

For an Orthographic camera, the amount of the world visible is driven by a special 'Size' property. 'Size' defines how much of the world is visible vertically.  Then the aspect ratio is used to determine how much to display horizontally.  

<hr></details>


## 1.11) Add an auto save script 

Create an editor script which automatically saves every time you hit play.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - In the Project Assets/Code/Editor directory:
   - Right click
   - Select 'Create' -> 'C# Script'
   - Name it **AutoSave**
 - Double click to open the file in Visual Studio.
 - Paste in the the following source code:
 
```csharp
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEditor.SceneManagement;

[InitializeOnLoad]
public class AutoSave
{
  static AutoSave()
  {
    EditorApplication.playmodeStateChanged
      += OnPlaymodeStateChanged;
  }

  static void OnPlaymodeStateChanged()
  {
    if(EditorApplication.isPlaying)
    { 
      return;
    }

    EditorSceneManager.SaveOpenScenes();
  }
}
```


<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

AutoSave is a script which will only run while testing in the Unity Editor.  Every time you hit play, the scene and project will save just before play begins.

You can confirm the save is working by noting the * in Unity's title.  This * indicates unsaved changes and should now go away every time you click play.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's an editor script / why is the folder name important?</summary>

Unity uses special folder names to drive certain capabilities.  Any script under a folder named "Editor" will only run while testing in the Unity editor (vs in your built game).

[Read more](
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpecialFolders.html) from Unity.

<hr>

</details>
<details><summary>What's InitializeOnLoad?</summary>

InitializeOnLoad is an attribute which enables the script.  The static constructor of any class with this attribute is executed before anything else in the game.

InitializeOnLoad is an editor only script and found under the UnityEditor namespace.

</details>
<details><summary>What's a C# attribute?</summary>

Attributes in C# are metadata added to classes, fields, or methods that may be queried by other classes.  In the AutoSave script, InitializeOnLoad, a Unity specific attribute, is used to ensure the static constructor on our AutoSave class is called when the game begins.

There are many [standard C# attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/attributes/index) and [Unity specific attributes](http://www.tallior.com/unity-attributes/) that may be used.  Here are examples of several attributes you might use:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Networking;

// Tells unity that this component only works
// if the GameObject also has a SpriteRenderer
[RequireComponent(typeof(SpriteRenderer))]
public class MyClassName : MonoBehaviour
{
  // Tells unity this field can be modified
  // in the inspector
  [SerializeField]
  // Limits the values you can enter 
  // in the inspector
  [Range(1, 10)]
  int count;

  // Used for multiplayer games to sync 
  // method calls
  [ClientRpc]
  void MyMethod() { }
}
```

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's a C# static constructor?</summary>

Every object in C# may include a static constructor, this applies to static and non-static classes.  A static constructor is guaranteed to be called once (and only once).  The constructor will run before the first object is instantiated, a field is accessed, or a method is called (i.e. it happens before you touch the class).  You never call the static constructor directly.

A static constructor is a private static method named the same as the class, with no parameters and no return type.

```csharp
public class MyClassName 
{
  static MyClassName() 
  {
    // This is executed once automatically, before we do 
    // anything else with MyClassName.
  }
}
```
<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's a C# delegate?</summary>

A delegate in C# is an object representing method(s) to call at a later time. You may encounter delegates under the following names: Events, Action, Func, and delegate. Under the hood these are all implemented with a 'multicast delegate'.  

When a method is added to a delegate to be called later, this is referred to as 'subscribing'.  Multicast delegate means that any number of methods may subscribe to the same delegate.  We use += when subscribing so not to overwrite any other subscribers.

```csharp
EditorApplication.playmodeStateChanged += OnPlaymodeStateChanged;
```

If the owner of the delegate (in the example above that's EditorApplication) may outlive the subscriber, the subscriber should unsubscribe when it's destroyed.  Also, any time you are no longer interested in future updates, unsubscribe.  We do this with -= to remove our method and leave any remaining methods subscribed.

```csharp
EditorApplication.playmodeStateChanged -= OnPlaymodeStateChanged;
```

Events are a common use case for delegates.  For example, you may have a GameManager with a field for Points include an event "onPointsChange".  Other components/systems in the game, such as Achievements and the UI, may subscribe to the onPointsChange event.  When a player earns points, a method in Achievements is then called which can consider awarding a high score achievement and a method in the UI is called to refresh what the player sees on-screen.  This way those components only need to refresh when something has changed as opposed to checking the current state each frame.

```csharp
using System;
using UnityEngine;

public static class GameManager
{
  public static event Action onPointsChange;
  static int _points;
  public static int points
  {
    get
    {
      return _points;
    }
    set
    {
      _points = value;
      if(onPointsChange != null)
      {
        onPointsChange();
      }
    }
  }
}

public class MyCustomComponent : MonoBehaviour
{
  protected void Awake()
  {
    GameManager.onPointsChange 
      += GameManager_onPointsChange; 
  }

  protected void OnDestroy()
  {
    GameManager.onPointsChange
      -= GameManager_onPointsChange;
  }

  void GameManager_onPointsChange()
  {
    // React to points changing
  }
}
```

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What about performance?</summary>

As an editor script, this logic is not included in the game you release.  Saving is incremental so there is very little time wasted when there is nothing new to save.  Unless you're one of the lucky ones who never sees Unity crash, this script is absolutely worth the time tradeoff.
