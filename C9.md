# 9) Ladders

## 4.6) Add ladders to the world

Create GameObjects and layout ladders in the world.  Set their tag to Ladder.  

Add a BoxCollider2D to each of the ladders and size it to use for climbing and set it as a trigger collider. An entity will be able climb ladders when its bottom is above the bottom of the ladder's collider and its center is inside.

<details><summary>How</summary>

Layout ladders:

 - Create a parent Ladder GameObject, add the ladder sprite(s).  We are using **spritesheet_tiles_23** and **33**.
   - Order in Layer: -2.
 - Position the ladder and repeat, creating several ladders - some which look broken:
   - The child sprite GameObjects should have a default Transform, with the exception of the Y position when multiple sprites are used.
   - It usually looks fine to overlap sprites a bit, as we do to get the space between ladder steps looking good.

 - Create a layer for "Ladder".
 - Select all the ladder GameObjects:
   - Change their layer to Ladder.
   - Add **FadeInThenEnable** to all the ladders.
 - Create a new parent GameObject to hold all the ladders.

<br>Add trigger colliders to the ladders:

 - Select all the Ladder GameObjects:
   - Add **BoxCollider2D**:
     - Check 'Is Trigger'.
     - Size it such that: 
       - The width to be thinner than the sprite (about .6).
       - The bottom of the collider is:
         - Just below the platform for complete ladders.
         - Aligned with the last step of broken ladders.
       - The top of the collider is just above the upper platform.

<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Layout ladders:

Sprites are added for the ladders with a negative Order in Layer so it appears behind the platforms and entities.  A layer is created allowing us to identify the collisions with ladders later on.  Like the Hammers, ladders fade in at the start of the level.

<br>Add trigger colliders to the ladders:

We are using trigger colliders to define the area of a ladder that entities may climb.  For example, we made the collider thinner than the ladder itself so that entities cannot climb the edges (which may look strange.)  

<br>Script:

LadderMovement will climb up or down a ladder, given input from a controller (via desiredClimbDirection).  The PlayerController was updated to read up/down movement and feed that to the LadderMovement component.

LadderMovement offers the following APIs for other components:

 - isOnLadder
 - ladderWeAreOn
 - An event for when the entity first gets on a ladder and when they get off.

Each FixedUpdate, we get on a ladder nearby if we are in bounds and there is desired movement in the correct direction (i.e. we can't walk down starting at the bottom of a ladder).  

Once on a ladder, LadderMovement will hold the entity's y position by controlling its y velocity.

Note there are some issues at the moment - you can't go down a ladder and on the way up the entity may pop a bit.  Both fixed in the next section.

<hr></details>

<details><summary>Why use sqrMagnitude instead of magnitude?</summary>

In this example both magnitude and sqrMagnitude would give us the same result, as is the case anytime we are comparing if one distance is greater or less than another.  sqrMagnitude executes much faster, so its preferred anytime you do not require the precision that magnitude gives you.

To calculate magnitude, you first calculate the squared magnitude and then take the square root.  Taking the square root is a difficult operation.

## 4.9) Change layers while climbing

While climbing a ladder disable physics, allowing entities to climb down.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Create script Components/Movement/**DisablePhysics**: TODO change layers

  List<Collider2D> impactedColliderList;

  protected void Awake()
  {
    myBody = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();

    impactedColliderList = new List<Collider2D>();
    Collider2D[] colliderList = GetComponentsInChildren<Collider2D>();
    for(int i = 0; i < colliderList.Length; i++)
    {
      Collider2D collider = colliderList[i];
      if(collider.isTrigger == false)
      {
        impactedColliderList.Add(collider);
      }
    }
  }

  protected void OnEnable()
  {
    for(int i = 0; i < impactedColliderList.Count; i++)
    {
      Collider2D collider = impactedColliderList[i];
      collider.isTrigger = true;
      myBody.gravityScale = 0;
    }
  }
   
  protected void OnDisable()
  {
    for(int i = 0; i < impactedColliderList.Count; i++)
    {
      Collider2D collider = impactedColliderList[i];
      collider.isTrigger = false;

<hr></details>

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

We disable physics (collisions and gravity) when getting on a ladder, and enable physics again when we get off.

The DisablePhysics component will disable collisions (by switching to trigger) and gravity (by setting gravityScale to 0) when enabled, and then restores the original values when disabled.

LadderMovement was updated to enable the DisablePhysics component when getting on ladders, and disable it when getting off.  The language here is confusing - but again enabling the DisablePhysics component turns off physics.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's a C# List?</summary>

In C#, a List is a an array which can easily and automatically be resized as needed.  As you add and remove elements, C# will manage the size of the array which holds the information.  It does not resize the array every time something is added or removed, it's optimized to try and limit those potentially expensive calls.  

When you create a List you give it the type of data it will contain.  We make the List for a specific type, as opposed to using objects, to communicate intent and for type safety - e.g. if we had a List<Dog> it's clear that Cats don't belong there, and if we attempted to add a Cat to the Dog list, C# would throw an error.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's rigidbody gravityScale do?</summary>

You can modify how much gravity impacts a specific object using its rigidbody's gravityScale.  Gravity scale is defined in percent, where 1 is the normal amount of gravity and 0 means gravity is disabled.

You can modify the gravity for all objects in the world using Project Settings -> Physics 2D -> Gravity, it defaults to (0, -9.81).

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why store the impacted collider list?</summary>

This component is disabling all colliders on the GameObject which were not already triggers.  When we undo this change, we don't have a way to detect the colliders original state.  We store list so we can change those colliders to not triggers anymore, without unintentionally changing a collider which is always supposed to be a trigger.

## 4.10) Random climb controller

Create a script for the HoverGuy and SpikeBall to control when to climb a ladder.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Create script Components/Movement/**RandomClimbController**:

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(LadderMovement))]
public class RandomClimbController : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  float oddsOfClimbingLadderUp = .9f;

  [SerializeField]
  float oddsOfClimbingLadderDown = .1f;

  [SerializeField]
  float minTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection = 1;

  [SerializeField]
  float maxTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection = 10;

  LadderMovement ladderMovement;

  protected void Awake()
  {
    ladderMovement = GetComponent<LadderMovement>();
  }

  protected void Start()
  {
    StartCoroutine(Wander());
  }

  IEnumerator Wander()
  {
    while(true)
    {
      SelectARandomClimbDirection();
      float timeToSleep = UnityEngine.Random.Range(
        minTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection,
        maxTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection);
      yield return new WaitForSeconds(timeToSleep);
    }
  }

  void SelectARandomClimbDirection()
  {
    if(ladderMovement.isOnLadder == false)
    {
      if(UnityEngine.Random.value <= oddsOfClimbingLadderUp)
      {
        ladderMovement.desiredClimbDirection = 1;
      }
      else if(UnityEngine.Random.value <= oddsOfClimbingLadderDown)
      {
        ladderMovement.desiredClimbDirection = -1;
      }
      else
      {
        ladderMovement.desiredClimbDirection = 0;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

 - Add **RandomClimbController** to the HoverGuy and SpikeBall.
 - On the SpikeBall, change:
   - Odds of climbing up: 0
   - Odds of climbing down: .5

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Not much yet.

This script will get the HoverGuy enemies to randomly climb up or down ladders, and the SpikeBalls will randomly climb down.  The problem is they are still walking or rolling, so they quickly get off the ladder and then pop back on top of the platform.

This works by periodically picking a random desired climb direction on the LadderMovement component.  LadderMovement will not do anything with this input until the enemy is positioned on a ladder to climb.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>If I set both odds to 50%, why does it go up more often then down?</summary>

In order to keep the implementation simple, we are checking if we should go up before checking if we should go down.  This order results in effectively lowering the odds for going down.

For example, if both odds were 50%:
 - We have a 50% chance of going up.
 - If not, then we have a 50% chance to go down.

Since we only consider going down when we are not going up, the actual odds of going down in this example are 25%.

You could update this algorithm to calculate the odds correctly.

<br>Stop rolling off:


 - Create a script Components/Movement/**StopMomentumOnLadder**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(Rigidbody2D))]
[RequireComponent(typeof(LadderMovement))]
public class StopMomentumOnLadder : MonoBehaviour
{
  Rigidbody2D myBody;

  float previousAngularVelocity;

  float previousXVelocity;

  protected void Awake()
  {
    myBody = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();

    LadderMovement ladderMovement = GetComponent<LadderMovement>();
    ladderMovement.onGettingOffLadder 
      += ClimbLadder_onGettingOffLadder;
    ladderMovement.onGettingOnLadder 
      += LadderMovement_onGettingOnLadder;
  }

  void LadderMovement_onGettingOnLadder()
  {
    previousAngularVelocity = myBody.angularVelocity;
    previousXVelocity = myBody.velocity.x;
    myBody.velocity = Vector2.zero;
  }

  void ClimbLadder_onGettingOffLadder()
  {
    myBody.angularVelocity = -previousAngularVelocity;
    myBody.velocity = new Vector2(-previousXVelocity, myBody.velocity.y);
  }
}
```

 - Add **StopMomentumOnLadder** to the SpikeBall.

<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

This change prevents the HoverGuy from walking while on a ladder.  HoverGuys will never stop moving in this game, they will walk constantly and when reaching a ladder they may climb straight up or straight down - and then resume walking.

When a SpikeBall gets on a ladder, we store its velocity (i.e. speed) and angular velocity (i.e. spin) and then set both to 0. This stops momentum the ball had from rolling down platforms, allowing it to climb straight up or down the ladder.

Once done climbing, we restore the momentum, but flip both values so that after getting off the ball is rolling in the opposite direction.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why not stop the WalkMovement component instead?</summary>

Stopping the HoverGuy via the WalkMovement component instead of the WanderWalkController would work fine for the HoverGuy.  However we share the WalkMovement component with the Character as well, and don't want to prevent the player from being able to walk off the side of a ladder.

You could alternatively put this logic in WalkMovement with a flag to indicate if ladders should prevent walking or not.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why not deregister events here?</summary>

We are assuming that this component will never be removed from the GameObject.  So both WanderWalkController and WalkMovement are expected to exist from Awake till OnDestroy.  When a GameObject is destroyed, the registered events are automatically garbage collected.

If we wanted to optionally remove this component, we would want to deregister the events to prevent a memory leak or unexpected behaviour.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why not stop and restart the coroutine instead?</summary>

You could stop the coroutine when getting on a ladder and then restart it when you get off.  The coroutine from WanderWalkController would need to be updated for this to work, ensuring that when we resume we don't sleep for that initial wait time again.

## 4.13) Move towards the center of the ladder

Add a script to the HoverGuy and SpikeBall to direct them towards the center of a ladder while climbing.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Create script Components/Movement/**MoveTowardsCenterWhileClimbing**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(LadderMovement))]
public class MoveTowardsCenterWhileClimbing : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  float speed = 1f;

  LadderMovement ladderMovement;

  protected void Awake()
  {
    ladderMovement = GetComponent<LadderMovement>();
  }

  protected void FixedUpdate()
  {
    GameObject ladder = ladderMovement.ladderWeAreOn;
    if(ladder != null)
    {
      float targetX = ladder.transform.position.x;
      float myX = transform.position.x;
      float deltaX = targetX - myX;
      if(Mathf.Abs(deltaX) > 0.01)
      {
        Vector2 target = transform.position;
        target.x += deltaX;
        transform.position = Vector2.MoveTowards(
          transform.position, 
          target, 
          speed * Time.fixedDeltaTime);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

 - Add **MoveTowardsCenterWhileClimbing** to the HoverGuy and SpikeBall.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Anytime an entity with this component is climbing a ladder, it will slowly move towards the center.  We use this on enemies because they will typically get on a ladder as soon as it is within range - but it looks better when they climb up/down the center instead of towards the edge.  

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why not use velocity to move?</summary>

You could.  

MoveTowardsCenterWhileClimbing uses MoveTowards to update the transform.position directly instead of moving via the rigidbody as you normally would.  We do this as a simplification.  

If you use velocity, be careful when you overshoot the target a bit so the entity does not appear to wiggle back and forth trying to settle on the exact center position.

## 4.14) Test

TODO

Debugging

 - If you can jump and start climbing a ladder you barely reach, check the contact filter configuration.
